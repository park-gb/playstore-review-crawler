0,1,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,5,iam_dejjee,"Great app. The only things I can complain about is the lag. It wasn't happening but all of a sudden I've become really laggy. Also it disconnects randomly me if my wifi status isn't all the way full or 1 bar away from being full. it only happens when I play the game, so I know it isn't my phone. My wifi will just randomly go off. You have no idea how difficult that makes it to play. Also my screen will sometimes freeze, and sometimes it'll lock too. Please fix it. I really like this game. Ty ❤️❤"
1,2,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,raesean collins,"This is a pretty cool app,I love how there different games, I really love simulators and more! And when I play I don't have any issues, it clear and great quality 👌. However sometimes the screen glitches and when you try to turn your screen it zoom in-out, and If you try to reset your character it doesn't work and you have to rejoin, but some if you wait it will Un glitch,but other than that no other problems."
2,3,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Daelynn,"This game is fun, you could play with a bunch of friends, games, and more. I've been playing this game for years and I wanted to say a few things.. if you press the menu button and try moving the joystick, the joystick moves the screen. it's an annoying glitch and I'm pretty sure that it hasn't been patched yet. also, i would recommend adding an ""recommendation"" thingy so we could request what we want in roblox and also other people could see our suggestions!"
3,4,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,3,Ti,"Buggy but it's fun. The camera sometimes bugs out and either makes it impossible to turn or it does a lot of other weird inputs like turning when walking, other times games will randomly get confused and think you're playing on PC all of a sudden making it unplayable until you leave and join back (which can be frustrating when you're in the middle of something). It's alright though, nice to be able to play roblox, with chat, without a PC."
4,5,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,Deonna Perkins,"I love this game i play it all the time. my only issues right now is that I have upgrade it so many times and then I have to delete apps just to play the game and the joystick bugs out at the worst time when you are playing a game (like a horror game), and at times it will think you are on PC, also I would like to talk about how me and many other people keep gets ban for no reason it makes no sense."
5,6,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,A Google user,"This game has so many different kinds of genres such as Jailbreak, Adopt Me, and Brookhaven. And they're all super fun, definitely reccomend. Although there is 2 glitches with the camera, other than that the game is flawless. Glitch #1: When you go to the player list there's a big chance your screen with glitch out and you won't be able to play normal, your joystick is like you're zooming in and out, you can't move your screen and it's just horrible. Glitch #2: Your screen locks."
6,7,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,3,LpsUndead Pro,I love this game but the mobile version has really irritating issues. Sometimes my game crashes or freezes when I'm trying to work on my avatar and sometimes my camera breaks and all I can do is zoom in and out. This has been happening for at least a month and I'm getting sick of it. I hate having to rejoin games because of a stupid camera bug. Especially games that have timers and countdowns for things.
7,8,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Your.Local.Hershey,"This is a good game overall, you can play with friends, costomize your character, and Robux is fairly cheep for a good amount. There are a few bugs tho. Your screen can get stuck on shift lock even if theres no option for it, sometimes it will glitch and not let you move your screen at all, resulting in you re-joining bc there's no other way to fix it. Which can be very annoying in unsavable obbys/tycoons and such. Other than that, very good game and would definitely recommend to my friends"
8,9,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Angela Erickson,"I love this game! It's super fun when I'm bored. I would enjoy it thought if the jump button wasn't so small for mobile device. I think a lot of the items in the shop as well as gamepasses are very spendy. Also, not sure if this is only me, but whenever I try to install roblox after unistalling the game, it usually never installs. It's always pending, and I can never get it to work. (Edit) I've changed my review, and I love it more. I still think some items are a bit spendy, but overall, love!"
9,10,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,KitKat OMG,"Amazing game! My favorite accualy. But there is this bug , but I'm not going to give it 4 stars because of that. But the bug is that when I'm typing, sometimes my keyboard (BTW I play on my phone) goes away.. I'm not sure why but it's quite annoying, but it might just be my phone. But I doubt that, because my phone is brand new. Otherwise, great game! 100% recommend. If you could fix this bug that would be great! Keep up the good work, creator!"
10,11,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,•Gacha_Zigz•,"This app is amazing! I have had it for many many many years now and love it! I have made lots of friends, met new people, and had so much fun, my favorite games at the moment are Adopt Me, Cheese Escape, Aperiaphobia (I think its spelled), and many more but the reason I am leaving a review is because I saw alot of people having a problem on mobile where the screen wont let you move as it zooms in and out, all you have to do is get off the game clear it and then turn your device off, get back on."
11,12,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,Dennis,It's great and has multiple experiences but people can bypass and do bad things. I randomly got kicked from one of my accounts because of my connection and I wasn't able to get it back but it doesn't matter sence it was a while ago. There is a glitch where your screen gets stuck and you can't move it and you can only zoom in and out. I've been playing for a while and it gives nothing but fun
12,13,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Phoenix Clinton,"This is a great game,YOU can make so many friends and there are so many games! It's so fun to play I'm addicted to it. I would rate it 5 stars but I have an issue... If your on mobile sometimes when you open the menu your joystick messes up and thinks it's the screen, for example you try to go forward you go forward BUT your screen goes up. Please fix this bug"
13,14,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Kasandra Hernandez,"i gave it a five star because it has no ads and there are plenty of games to play. it's the only game i play and can never get tired of playing, but there is a problem i hope roblox fixes. whenever i accidentally click on a notification and go back to playing its hard to move the screen. while i move my character the screen moves aswell and it's annoying everytime because i always have to leave and rejoin the game. i hope they do fix it so playing can be alot more fun for everyone!"
14,15,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Lorraine Coyle,Pretty good. But after a long time (Like 1 year or 2) it gets kinda boring. Also I belive this is a commom glitch but sometimes when you are playing a game (For me it has just been bloxburg) you try to move you view / angle you can only zoom in and out. But this is a minor glitch and all you have to do is rest to fix it. Thats it! Overall GREAT game. Now I am off to play some more.
15,16,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,A Google user,"there are so many games to play. I like that it has different types of games so you can play what you want. Something irritating about playing on mobile is that it sometimes makes me zoom in and out instead of allowing me to turn my camera. It's really frustrating because it means I have to leave and rejoin, reseting character doesn't fix the issue."
16,17,2022-08-23,2022,08,23,1,Christopher,"Even on the best wifi service, this game still proceeds to lag. I can't even turn my camera without worrying that it will get stuck. And I have 2 questions: Why is the joy stick and thumbstick so small and What is the problem with making the joystick and thumbstick bigger? And the camera is so sensitive that it will turn to another direction without reason And I asked the devs to help me with hackers, Inappropriate context, Bugs Etc and not once did they fix my problems. Fix this PLEASE!"
17,18,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Barbara McKnight,"Its an amazing game with so many new people you can meet, and its quick to get into a game or server. Best thing is, you can even make your own game! I'm telling you if you love fun, exploring, challenges, roleplaying, and more you should consider getting the app. There will be updates that come once in a while but, they aren't much of a problem and help to make the app run smoother."
18,19,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,T eh,"I've been playing for years and it just keeps getting better. The graphics are vivid once in possession of the right device and excellent service. There is an abundance experiences to choose from. Avatar customization options are infinite, due to the frequent updates, and the ability to design the outfit of one's Avatar."
19,20,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Rainbow God,"This game has it's downsides, for example getting rid of the oof sound, lots of hacking issues and I could go on all day. But to be honest, it's not as bad as the average person says. There's lots of classics, and you'll get lots of nostalgia when playing games like Roblox Crossroads if you played back in 2006 or 2007. There's also some REALLY good graphics in a handful of games as well. There's also literally BILLIONS of BILLIONS of games of your liking! Overall, it's not the best, but awesome!"
20,21,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,B1qil,"Fun, it is very addicting, when I play, I play until an electronic dies and then im screwed. A few problems I have is the glitch where instead of moving your screen, you zoom in and out uncontrollably. And sometimes when I use the dynamic thumbstick, it moves my screen as well, of which can go on for multiple minutes at a time."
21,22,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,chip,"Small bugs, they especially show up for mobile players. But computer isn't to bad. It has everything, yeah everything. You kinda gotta get your moderation fixed. I got a warning for uploading a decal of a dark blue color, yet maybe hundreds of worse things get accepted without hesitation. You NEED to sort that out. Either way, it has a lot of games and it's pretty easy to make friends who share the same interests as you. I would reccomend!"
22,23,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Selena Mayeshiba,"Roblox is a great game that has plenty of variety for games, but there are some camera glitches on mobile I would like to talk about. Sometimes, the screen freezes, and I have to leave and rejoin. Other times, when I use the joystick, it's as if I am zooming in and out of the camera. If this could get fixed it would be an easy 5 stars, but otherwise, it is a great game to play with friends! It has it's uos and downs, but it's a great game."
23,24,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Talia A,"I love Roblox, and I grew up on it. I do have two issues though. If I respond to a message on my phone or open the panel where you can see the people that are in the sever or where you can leave the game and close that panel, the screen has a glitch where it zooms in and out. I've seen other people are having this issue too. The second issue it where I try to move my screen and it moves my entire character like I am zoomed in. Fix it please?"
24,25,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Roblox player 2.0,"This game is good I just have some problems. #1 when I join a game it takes longer for others than me and sometimes is really glitchy with 2 or more people playing. #2 I know everyone has this bug but when I equip an item it says something like ""the selected items you equipped are no longer available"" It's really annoying because I have to go back and equip. #3 This hardly ever happens but when I play a game Roblox glitches, freezes, then relloads. Please fix this!"
25,26,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,Landon Hillyard,"I love this game, I use it almost all the time. It's very fun to play with friends. I'd recommend children 10 years or older can play. The game consists of multiple experiences created by other users on the app and, you can also create your own game. There's options for parents to limit interaction with other players online if they choose. I've noticed a problem that has been complained about before, when you open up the main UI in-game, sometimes it bugs your screen. (Only affects mobile users)"
26,27,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,John Merritt,"This game is so fun for me I love playing it. However sometimes I recieve little bugs on some games and glitches where it just kicks me off the game. It's also a little hard to play on a computer. Especially obbies. But other than that, if those were fixed, I would give this game a 10/10! I would definately still recomend this game to anyone. Especially younger kids :)"
27,28,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Ava Myers,"HELLO!! Roblox is a great game, but I wanted to say what caused the issue of not moving the camera the right way, or the 'zooming' glitch. When You're moving you player in the game as you click the Player list or menu, it will cause this bug with your camera. But if you stop walking first, it should be mostly fixed. Leaving and re-joing fixes this bug as well. I've learned from personal experiences and tested this, so I know it works. Try it for yourself if you have this problem!"
28,29,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,4,No,"It is cool, there are lots of games to choose from. I like that you can play on mobile or pc, however there are some glitches on mobile that you don't find on computer. For example sometimes the screen/camera glitches and you either cant move the camera or it zooms in/out instead of turning. Besides that it is pretty good. I like that there is so many character customization options as well, although you have to pay for some of them."
29,30,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Ellie Torres,This game is great! But some annoying things happens when your on mobile like sometimes I can only zoom in and out so I have to rejoin the game again. And the jump button will press it's self nonstop and it's a little bit hard to play. I don't really know if this happens to everyone but whenever your play a game it just send you back to the Roblox loading screen it doesn't really happens that much. But still Roblox is a great game! I would highly recommend this game!
30,31,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Bug,"I'm giving it 5 stars because I grew up on this game it defined an entire generation, not alot of games can accomplish that. However there are some issues,in some games when you exit the player list you can move your camera at all, and sometimes the dynamic joystick bugs out and control ls both the camera and the and the players movement, usually this isn't a problem, however with my device I have to use the classic joystick, which makes it difficult to play because I play on my phone. Fix it?"
31,32,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Gabby,"Game is awsome! There are so many games to choose from and you can edit and so many other things!! But why did I rate it 4 stars? Well, sometimes I type in a normal question and it tags. Also, when I buy something, after like a week it's unavilable. It really frustates me and I really wish we could refund! There's also been a problem with the screen. Sometimes when I'm playing a game It locks and I can't move and can only zoom. But very great game! Keeps me entertained all the time!!"
32,33,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,That Weirdo Gurl,"I definitely love Roblox. I usually play it on my laptop but I lost my mouse so I have been playing it on my phone. I know a lot of people have glitching problems, but personally I don't. I don't like that in some games the developer has the option to choose which movement mode you have to use, but I guess I can overlook it for now. Overall, great app!"
33,34,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,tigers in hell,"I rate 5 stars because I grew up on it, but there are some issues and bugs if you could fix them roblox I would play more. #1. Sometimes the screen bugs out and u can't really walk unless your screen gets zoomed out, but you can fix it by getting in a car if ur in a game like brookhaven, adopt me, etc. with cars u can but if there are no cars you can't. You can't reset your character and it go back to normal, you would have to rejoin. Well that's all I can think of right now I will re-edit it"
34,35,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,Maria Perez,"I love this game! This game is full of loads of fun and other stuff. Although, there are a few downfalls. Some games can get laggy for no reason. You could have perfectly good internet and nothing happening in the game and it just starts lagging. Another thing is that there is this bug in ANY game where you don't have control of the screen and it just starts zooming in and out. I find that annoying because it ruins my experience in a game. But it is really fun and an awesome game! I recommend!"
35,36,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Justin Little,"Best app no contest, it's almost perfect but there is 2 flaus, 1. when I go to play a game it's almost instant when it shuts the game off and put me on the home screen then I have to shut the whole app down to get it off the main screen, & 2. Sometimes when I play a game, the screen locks and its really annoying, but other than that, it's perfect."
36,37,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Olivia Myers,"Great: but I have a issue This game is very great, most of the time when I get the chance to play this game I do, but i do have one issue. Sometimes when trying to move the screen it wouldn't move, it can only zoom in and out and it was interrupting my gameplay, and most of the time I have to exit the game for it to go back to normal, and sometimes I get disconnected randomly as well Other than that, this game is very fun, just needs a little fixing then and there."
37,38,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,5,Gayle Ducharme,"Roblox is one of my favorite games to play but there are a few little problems. The first problem is randomly the screen will lock and I can't move, and the second problem is sometimes when I go to move the only thing is does is make the screen go in and out.... other than that everything else about this app is amazing and I recommend this to whoever is reading this!!"
38,39,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Melanie Guzman,"Roblox is a great game, lots of experiences. And is a great game for u and ur friends. I have 1 problem tho. Sometimes when playing a game the screen glitches. It doesn't move. And it's frozen and when you reset your character it really doesn't do anything. You can only zoom in and out. I really hope Roblox fixes this. I bet lots of people are having the same experience. Other than that. It's a great game."
39,40,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Stephanie Gaston,"This app is great. It allows you to interact with others and make friends, and you can also learn things on the app. So its an educational experience and also a fun app to cure your boredom. Its a fun game for kids, and adults! But sometimes there is a few issues. For example; sometimes when I am still for a moment, the screen glitches and zooms in and out. I hope that it is fixed soon. Other than that, Im rating it 5 stars."
40,41,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Ralsei Key,"It's just a little away from being flawless, the thing with flaws is either your device, or your wifi/service(<-which ever one you use). I play it with absolutely no problems and I play on an newer phone. Like I said, depends, it is definitely true that when you receive a message or something snd it comes up on the screen, when you try to change the camera angle it just barely moves your character and only zooms in and out. No other problems I know of lol."
41,42,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,S1mply_K1tty,"Roblox is a great game, but I'm experiencing issues with the Avatar Editor. I don't know if it's because I purchased too many pants and shirts, but all of my old pants and shirts just aren't showing up anymore. Sure I can close the game and open it back up, but it's just going to keep making my shirts and pants not show up. Also, whenever I equip something, it sometimes has a message saying ""Some items that were equipped are no longer available""."
42,43,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Hopeless Hobi,"I've played Roblox for years, and have had no problems with it and overall, have no issues but one. When I try to buy robux, I tap on it and it just doesn't show any options to buy any, this also happens when trying to look at a player's profile trying to look at their past usernames, and also happens when trying to change my password. I play on mobile and this might not happen to people on PC."
43,44,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Juice Man,Nice game👍. I've had the same issues as all the replys. The in and out bug. Now the only way to prevent this from happening is to not press the Roblox Button when you are moving and in the game. And that's not even a bug it just normally happens if you accidentally press the Roblox button (happens to me alot of times..Unfortunately..). And it sometimes happens when you press the home button on your phone (ios or Android). I hope this helps for the people asking to fix the issue up.👍
44,45,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,3,Misha Ayala Orozco,"I LOVE Roblox! Ever sense I found out about it, it's basically all I played! But, it does have issues. Whenever I'm playing a type of game, it would take forever to load or kick me out back to homescreen. The screen would also freeze or make it to where the joystick glitches. My device would also say ""Roblox is not responding"" and I would keep trying to play until it would work again. Yes, it's a great game, but it needs work. I would love it even more if you fixed these issues please!"
45,46,2022-07-14,2022,07,14,5,keiti -,"This game is nearly perfect. everything is fine if u are on a good device, works well even for Android phones.the catalog has many items to choose from. All styles and aesthetics are able to make avatars that will be exactly their style. The rthro avatars are just ugly most of the time though. Most people aren't a fan of rthro. The games are unique and fun to play too! You can easily find the right game to fit your criteria if you search for it! Five star rating."
46,47,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Krystal Post,"This game is awsome, the new 3D clothes are awaome as well, some of my favorite are Warrior cats: ultimate edition, and Gacha online, very fun games and thank to roblox I can play them!, If you don't have the app, you should get it, but there is some problems, like when you're screen glitches, instead of looking around you just zoom in and out, and another downfall, is something that happens to me and a few of my friends, when we try to leave or reset, if freezes up, other then that great game!"
47,48,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Ryder Kaiden,"Really good game. but there is some bugs like when you play on mobile. the joystick is very small""not really a bug"". however i do play on tablet so good for me. also sometimes when you go to the player list. and then turn your camera. it zooms in or zooms out. and when you join a really laggy game that is really good. it just crashes. ""only for me i think"" but really great game."
48,49,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Jessalyn Apilado,"Amazing, but it has its flaws. Occasionally on mobile you can accidentally open the settings and the screen will go all wonky or just freeze up entirely, and lately I've been having trouble joining and moving. I crash, glitch, and lag a ridiculous amount of times. Overall, the best game I've played! Just please fix these things, it would help a ton."
49,50,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,4,Eric K Yung,"Great game. There are a few bugs and issues though. On certain games your screen just suddenly stops turning around and goes in and out, no matter how you move it. Sometimes, it gets really laggy and glitchy that it kicks users out of the game. There should also be a option to change your main screen to any color you would like and have more clothes options for people without Robux. Other than that, I would love to keep playing this game! 🤗"
50,51,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Carlos Marone,"It's a great game, with thousands of cool games with all different genres and super entertaining. However, mobile users such as myself have reported a LOT of glitches and lag. For me, I can be playing a game and then all of a sudden my screen freezes and my screen turns black and says one of two things, one of them being ""Roblox is not responding"". It would be great if I knew whether if was Roblox's issue or mine. But again, the game is awesome!"
51,52,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,3,anjel,"Roblox is a great app, it really is. I do have an issue though, and people that I know have had the same issue. Sometimes when playing a game, the screen glitches and however you touch the screen or reset, it does nothing. All it does is zoom in and out. It will barely move your avatar, and instead, just zoom in and out. We've all had this problem on mobile and I hope Roblox fixes this bug."
52,53,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,5,Preppy Gal,"This Game Is Awesome! Although, the moblie version has a few glitches. 1. When Im playing, the game will freeze and I can't move my character, and then i disconnect from the game. 2. When I try to enter a game the screen freezes and roblox shuts down. I dont know if it's just my phone or if its a problem with the game. If it is a problem with the game can it please be fixed to increase the quality? Anyways, I give it 5/5 stars."
53,54,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,4,XxSadiexX,"I'd have to say Roblox is quite the game to enjoy! It's an amazing game to connect with friends on. However, there are sometimes where I'm playing and I may turn the joystick the wrong way and my screen is stuck in one angle. So I have to leave the game and rejoin. Or occasionally the jump button will be stuck and I can't move it. Hopefully you can fix these issues! (Mobile wise-) The app deserves 4 stars in my opinion. One missing star due to bugs. Please fix them!"
54,55,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,4,Nexiled Flare,"Being on the platform has been great, but often times I find myself extremely limited in several games that include using multiple items. More specifically, due to my device, I only have 3 hotbar slots. This is an issue in experiences where you need to use many different items in a short amount of time. Opening the inventory too quickly will both fail to open the inventory and waste time. It would be preferable to allow players to choose how many hotbar slots to have, with adjusting icon sizes."
55,56,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,3,Hunter D,"ROBLOX has made my day so much, but despite the amazing changes to the game there are some issues, for example roleplaying games, the camera model will often malfunction or ""break"" so I can only zoom in and out and only face in one direction. This is becoming a very annoying situation, as the only I've found to repair this is to leave, or to go back to the editor. This is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher, ROBLOX makes my day everyday. Thank you for this amazing experience."
56,57,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Gianna,"Love the game, it runs smoothly most of the time on my device, but today it keeps crashing and I don't know what's wrong. Played it earlier, no issues, but it's unplayable now. I restart my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, nothing helped. Three stars until I can play again. Edit: working again! Must've been a glitch or something"
57,58,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,4,Khaleesi Hernandez,"I would rather this five stars if on mobile, there weren't as many problems. For example, sometimes my screen will get stuck one way, but sometimes that is one all devices. And on mobile, sometimes the screen is so small when I try to move I exit the game, and sometimes on mobile it doesn't let me play certain ones either. But after all that was said, It's a great game, but I recommend playing in Computers, laptops, or TV's."
58,59,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,Katlyn Worley,"This is a great game, my top favorite actually! But there are alot of glitches like for example, sometimes I'll be playing a game and my screen will lock and I can't move it. And another one, sometimes I'll try to move my screen but instead of changing the view it just zooms in and out.. and there should be more avatar options that you can choose without robux because some people like me can't get robux but I don't wanna be a bacon or something like that. But overall this is a great game."
59,60,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,5,Kassie PoG,"It's a neat app! You can play millions among millions of fun and creative games. But there is a few flaws: 1. If you move your screen and or character and press the top left button, it will open as usual (during game play) but if you press resume or simply press the X button, your screen will sometimes lock in place as soon as you return and the only way of fixing it is leaving the game and rejoin it. And 2: clothing and game moderation isn't the best at detecting inappropriate content."
60,61,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,Holly Cota,"It's a great app with great games, however lately there has been a shift lock bug. After playing games I always used to play, I suddenly get trapped in shift lock. For example, Tower of Fun, I went in shift lock for a second and then I turned it off, but I was still in shift lock. and I know I am not the only one because there have been videos proving this issue exists. So please, PLEASE fix it."
61,62,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,4,Bernard Kimani,"I would have this game 5 stars if there weren't as many problems. For example when your on a game and your using the joystick your screen gets stuck and you can't move your player and can only zoom in and out. This is a really frequent problem that makes it hard to enjoy and play a game. Another problem is when I'm joining a game, playing one, or on the main menu of roblox it says my internet KEEPS on disconnecting. I'm not sure if its just my internet or something else. But its a good game!"
62,63,2022-07-12,2022,07,12,4,Caelyn Burkett,"I love this game! It's a very fun app, but I have my complaints, sometimes I'm trying to join one of my friends and this has only happened a few times, but I was joining one of my friends the other day, and right in the middle of joining it said Same account launched in different experience. Please try again later (Error Code:) or something like that and I tried 2 more times, once it did it again, the second no. Also a while ago my wifi was messed up and now I'm really laggy, please fix this."
63,64,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Lamar Carter,Roblox is one of the best apps that I dream to play as but there's a few problems with the game at time when you join games the screen will turn out black and I heard that some things will be deleted and that thing that made it help to be offered to but because of that is that incident there's a lot of glitches and a lot more than I probably need to be fixed but all out it's a great game that I dreamed to play!! :7
64,65,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,ItsBitzKitz,"I mean, sure, it's fun for the first year or so, but there are a lot of issues. To name a few, Roblox recently removed the classic and beloved ""oof"" death sound and replaced it with a weird new sound. I can't describe what it sounds like, but it's.. odd. I feel as if Roblox is losing those unique little details that make it Roblox. Also, there is a glitch where your screen gets stuck and you can only zoom out while playing a game."
65,66,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Paige Collins,"Okay, Everything about this game is amazing, but every once and awhile the screen just gets stuck and moves only in and out, it gets nerve-wracking to play with, and usually the only way to get rid of it is to completely exit out of the game, Multiple of my friends have had this happen but I have only seen it happen on mobile, never on pc. If this could get fixed that would be amazing! Other than that small thing I would definitely recommend this to anyone on pc and mobile!"
66,67,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,RestlessWolf 06,"I've been playing roblox since 2015 and I do really love the app and I've met some great people on it. I do have some complaints though. #1, phone there is this glitch where your screen gets stuck every few minutes. #2, on iPad, I get kicked out every few hours or so because It says ""Same account launched off different device"" even though I do not cause this. #3, the catalog on phone is so laggy. I'm hoping these bugs can be fixed in the future, but overall pretty okay game."
67,68,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Carl Kovach,"Very fun and social game, good for kids to make new friends, robux isn't too expensive, very fun experiences, and no adds! There's just one problem though, when I play my favorite game on there called Fashion Famous lots of times when I get in my screen will freeze and lag, and sometimes it even kicks me out of the whole entire app, and then I have to restart my tablet or otherwise it won't let me get into the app. Fix this bug and I will give it 5 stars but for now, it's gonna be 4 stars!"
68,69,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Andrea Alvarez,"I like this game! But every single time I update its says it doesn't work please send a feedback. And I always click on something my screen doesnt work it just zooms in and out even on the moments I worked so hard on, I always have to rejoin the game, sometimes l click on resume many times till it work, but if you play a game that is a srory it will work again. So, Roblox please fix all of the problems that everyone has to deal with and thank you for reading this review! Have a good day"
69,70,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,3,Violet Stair,"This game is great and that's why there's 3 stars, but the other two is 1. Because my screen goes black and I have to turn my phone back on then it gets me off the game. I know this is a popular opinion so if you can please fix it. 2. Sometimes I go on Roblox and it never stops loading so I clean out all my apps, delete pictures, get rid of notifications, even restart my phone. Sometimes it works- sometimes it doesn't. I know this game is a lot so it's hard to keep everything in order. No rush!"
70,71,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,A Single Pair of Socks,"Definitely one of my favorite games, but when I play on my phone, sometimes my screen will move around while I walk and if I try to use my other hand to turn, it just zooms in and out and the only way I know how to fix it is by leaving and rejoining the game I was originally playing. Overall really fun game with minimal glitches from the game itself."
71,72,2022-06-17,2022,06,17,5,Moon Armano,"Love this game soooo much!! I've been playing for years, since I was in elementary (im in middle school now). I love the variety of games and the fact that they're created by other players. There's no ads distrubting your game, and the few ads that there are don't get in the way and are, once again, created by other players. Sometimes it is a lot for slower computers to handle on certain games, but I've found it to be an overall great experience. It's a great escape from reality. 🤍🤍🤍🤍"
72,73,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,3,T W,"I personally love roblox, but there has been many issues stated in the reviews and the issue has still not yet been fixed. One problem, when you use this certain thumb stick, when you try to move it moves your screen as well. 2, My screen locks for absolute no reason, or when I tap two fingers on the screen, or tap the screen repeatedly. I can't move it at all! 3. This is the most common glitch for mobile, your screen locks and zooms in and out for the same reason as 2! It completely ruins it."
73,74,2022-06-04,2022,06,04,5,Gabriela,"It's a good game, just one issue. I've been playing Roblox for almost 5 years now, and it's amazing. There's a small issue where when I go to change or buy something in the shop on the app (phone) it stays in the loading screen but never actually loads. The only way I can fix it is by uninstalling and installing again. Again, it's a great game but it's not a reason to not play. Please fix this bug because it's very annoying. Overall, very good game and I recommend this app."
74,75,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,5,Tord,I love the app! It bring out creativity and sometimes learning. But there are a few bugs. When I would join a game and everyone would stop moving and I'd be able to move with no problems but when I texted my friend later that day he said that it was just me and I have really good wifi. Maybe you guys can fix it but otherwise it's a great game!
75,76,2022-07-03,2022,07,03,5,Kelsi Hallstrom,"I love this game so, so much. It is the perfect game with so many different experiences and genres and very inclusive for everyone. Even my dad plays it! However, like many are saying, it has it's bugs as well. Like the chat filter, for example. I love that it has a chat filter so that it's a safe site for everyone.. but it can go too far. You can spend minutes writing something out for a roleplay (just an example), and it tags half of the text. Overall, great game. So fun and awesome."
76,77,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,NoobyNub,"I LOVE THIS GAME! Now since I love this game you would've thought I would've rated it 5 stars, I really wish I could, but there is a small problem with it, every once and a while my screen goes all wonky and freezes up, or my screen just makes me only zoom in a out, it's quite a issue for me when I'm playing games that rely on the camera, other than that issue, it's a wonderful game to play with friends!"
77,78,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,Felicita Cruz,"Its a fun game and you have millions of games to pick in just one game with is awesome and creative! But there's just many bugs and problems in the game.For an example, when you move your joystick but your screen moves with it. Just a bug that needs to be fixed."
78,79,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,4,Maxine Moon,"Personally, I really do enjoy this! The various experiences, creations, and friends you can make! This app's popularity well deserved. I'll give it 4 stars, though. there are a few difficulties in the chat, like when the chat filter doesn't work right. I've tried to send various messages for example, yet NONE of them worked. Please fix this. So, other than that, I love this app! Hope the rest do too."
79,80,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,morgan,"There are a lot of issues with the game right now. The game has no ads, lots of fun games, but when I go to play a game, it says ""Check your internet and try again."" My internet's FINE.Also the Kohl's admin incident. Please fix that! Also, on mobile when you go to look around, it only zooms in and out, and when you try to type it won't show what your saying. Other than that, super fun game!"
80,81,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,5,Kaylee Sanchez,Okay I'm changing my review for 2 reasons. One is that when I'm trying to log in to my account it says wrong username or password even though it's right and after multiple tries it finally wants to work. Also the new dice thingy I know it's a safety precaution but it can get a bit annoying sometimes. Other than that the game is pretty good and enjoyable.
81,82,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Shaian,"Yes, a very fun game overall. Just that for somereason it thinks im playing on a phone sometimes even though im on a laptop, specificaly a chromebook. Also on a chromebook cursor doesn't stay in the center when in first person, it just moves across the screen and makes it really hard to play. If there is a few things to fix it would be that."
82,83,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Eva Springstead,"Roblow is a great game, however there is a few down sides. Sometimes the game will glitch and I won't be able to move around my screen and can only zoom in and out. Also it will kick me out of games or severs out of know where and I won't be able to get back in. Over all it is a great app with so many amazing generas and experiences to play."
83,84,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,3,Nutter Udder Man,"The main issues are the camera, lag, & the lack of features. The camera is sometimes controlled with the thumbstick, and if you swipe at the same time you open then menu, you're only able to zoom in & out. The games aren't optimized well for mobile, & sometimes large chunks of the ground don't render, & allow my charcter to fall through. Along with that, in some games instead of the display trying to catch up, it makes a pop up which prevents you from moving. And on mobile, there's no library."
84,85,2022-07-11,2022,07,11,4,Solar Shih,"It's a really good game overall. There is just one bug that's been annoying me ever since 2018. I usually play on a PC, but when I play on a phone, or tablet, sometimes my screen zooms in and out after just trying to look around. It happens when you click the Roblox icon on the top left and you touch the grey transparent parts."
85,86,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Eriana Lopez,"Amazing 🤩 many games to explore and experience! But the one thing Roblox has to get rid of is the hackers. It isn't fair of how hard people work for their Roblox account and it just goes to waste. Please fix this as best as you can. I have been hacked before and I hated it. I still continue to play now but it's just not fair. I hope you can fix this. Another thing I have noticed is in most of the games we are all blockys. I hope you can fix that too. But overall, the game is great!! Love it!!!"
86,87,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,5,A Google user,"VERY GOOD, the only problem i have with this game is, a mobile glitch: when your moving your screen on mobile you can tap on the menu, if you do this your camera will be stuck and you can only zoom in or out, the ony way to fix this is to leave the game. This can be very annoying in games like: bedwars or skywars."
87,88,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Talia A,"I love Roblox, and I grew up on it. I do have two issues though. If I respond to a message on my phone or open the panel where you can see the people that are in the sever or where you can leave the game and close that panel, the screen has a glitch where it zooms in and out. I've seen other people are having this issue too. The second issue it where I try to move my screen and it moves my entire character like I am zoomed in. Fix it please?"
88,89,2022-06-19,2022,06,19,3,campbell,"Roblox is a really fun game, I play it with my friends all the time. But whenever I play certain games it always thinks that I'm on mobile when I'm really using my computer. It's super annoying, the mouse doesn't stay in the middle of the screen like its supposed to and you can't turn one direction over and over again because the mouse will bump the edge of the screen. Other than that, it's great."
89,90,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Tristan McMillan,"A great game. You can choose all the games you wish, and whatever you search up is most likely there. Some games are for specific devices, and some are masterpieces alone. But whatever you play, an RPG, a battle game, or some story, you can find it! I love this game and have multiple accounts (sadly, I keep losing track of them and lose them), and I highly recommend this game."
90,91,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,3,Ivanushka _,"For the most part, I've always loved Roblox as a game. It's fun, and not too laggy in most games I play. Recently though, I've been experiencing an issue that majorly changes my opinion. The leaderboard, chat open/close, and settings and everything buttons than are usually at the top of the screen are just gone. I've tried everything to fix it, but can't. It affects my admin in some games, which changes a lot. Please fix this!!! I wish to keep playing Roblox, but can't with this issue :["
91,92,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,4,Trinity James,"This app is really fun, there are a variety of different games you can play my personal favorite is either brookhaven or Royal High. The game is a great way to let out stress as well, however It gets kinda annoying with updates. I always have to delete an app or 2 that might just be a problem with me I dont know. Overall its a great game."
92,93,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Kiara Day,"This game is really fun despite the robux being pricey and only use real money and robux cards to get it. There's some lag but I don't mind! I recommend installing this game, the problem though, once I type in the chat the screen ""freezes"" and I am unable to move it unless I press the right or left key on my chromebook 2 times. I still recommend installing as I said!"
93,94,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,Laci Banks,"Roblox is amazing! You can make tons of friends! You can also change your character!! But there is some problems, First.. Sometimes when you play a game it's really laggy but even tho you get a private server it's still laggy, Second.. When you move the screen it goes in and out however you do it it won't go normal, Last of all.. Also whoever made this we will recommend to play this so happy to play it!!"
94,95,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,4,Chxrry_piez,"This game is nice and really popular, and I love all the games you can play with your friends.I would rate it 5 stars, but I do have a few issues. I play on mobile and sometimes the games glitch and freeze. When I play Brookhaven, it glitches to where I can see through the walls. I play a game called ""Happy Runner"" and when the game freezes, it gets me kicked out of Roblox. It takes forever to load, so I have to go out of the app and go back in. Please fix these problems."
95,96,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Hayley Tomlinson,"Overall, the game is amazing, but sometimes when I pull up the roblox icon to reset my screen glitches. So every time I try to zoom in/out it will just move my camera in a weird way. It's very very annoying. Also when I try to layer hairs it doesn't let me. I've even done it on pc and it says something like ""You can't layer this"""
96,97,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Elizabeth Blank,"this game is really fun and takes my mind off stressful things. i love all the options for games to play and i love how cheap the currency is however, i have been hacked once and they did change my pass but i got the account back at least but anyways i really hope in the future you can change that abillity. ive had a great experience with game and no issues except for that one time. if you are looking for a game to hangout and make friends with, this game is perfect for you like it was for me!!!"
97,98,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Turtle Clan,"I would like it so you don't get kicked for being afk for 20 minutes or more. I play a lot of games where you go afk and get lots of stuff and I don't like to have to go over to my device every 18 minutes to reset the timer. Please fix this issue. Other than that the game is amazing. I would also like if you made it so if you went in first person you can see your body, arms, and legs like in real life. Also FIX UR DUMB CHAT FILTERS!!! Please..."
98,99,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,5,Mrs. Lonely Potato,"This game is great! I love playing it daily and I think its amazing. I do have some problems of course, but otherwise its a great app. I do have some suggestions for updates, number one, when you block someone, I don't think they should be able to join any groups you've made. Second, you can rate different games to leave for the developer much like you can here. Overall it is an AMAZING app and I 100% recommend!"
99,100,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Taliah Herman,"I love the game! But the thing is that I have had to reset my password 10 times in total because your app. Ether I have been getting hacked or your app doesn't work correctly. I would like this to be improved. On the other hand, it has a lot of options for your avatar and it is a little bit overpriced to change it but for the most part it's fine. The games are amazing although people copy others games which make it very confusing to play. But overall this app is great fun for all ages!"
100,101,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,3,Springbonnie315,"Roblox is a pretty fun and entertaining-like game. It does have 2 issues, or atleast that i have encountered maybe more people also have this bug while playing different types of games(experiences, as thats what they call them now, sadly.) #1 The glitch where my camera zooms in and out everytime i touch the screen to pick something up in-game or pretty much just rotate my screen to where i can see while walking. #2 The camera often becomes one with the joystick when im using my phone. Thats all."
101,102,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Siena T.,"I absolutely love this game because, 1: You can play with other people and chat in real time, 2: Different games for different types of people, 3: You can make friends with people and chat privately (be careful for bad ppl tho) and 4: You can fully customize your avatar and even create games and clothes if you have a premium membership! The controls are good and you can play on mobile or PC, and the graphics are ✨AMAZING ✨ Edit: It's definitely aimed towards younger audiences, gets boring."
102,103,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,3,MarMar cool,"Roblox is of course great and all but it really has some issues when it comes to the chromebook that needs improving. There are games where first person is the only camera mode, which would be great except it's very hard to pick up items and press where necessary in the game, as when you try to click it moves off to the side. Also for chromebook, the regular page sucks as you cannot scroll to see other games or things in catalog."
103,104,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,4,Brian Richards,"Still play it, but it has gone down hill. When I was little I played it nearly everyday, but now it lacks some good stuff it used to have. One thing that annoys me is the glitches, (And I do understand, fixing bugs can be very hard) The camera glitch where when you walk and turn the camera a certain angle it will just disable the camera and you must leave a game to fix it. But still I would recommend downloading."
104,105,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,5,Juliana Shephard,"THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. There's so many games to play along with having friends and chatting with people,and you can even make a game yourself! There's also character costumization witch is great. This game dose occasionally have bugs,but overall it's an amazing game.and if I had to choose one thing that could be added is the addition of earning robux instead of just having to buy it."
105,106,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Minjay,"Roblox is a great game, and I've been playing it for years. After switching to playing on my chromebook, it was good and all, but then I encountered a problem. Whenever I join a game- no matter what game, I can't seem to see chat bubbles. Which means in games without a chat box, I can't even talk to people. This only happens on my chromebook, but my iPad works just fine. Overall, Roblox is a great game to play, and it's really fun!"
106,107,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,5,Bread,"Great game! I saw a lot of reviews saying that they can only zoom in and out, I have experienced this but I know how to prevent it. DO NOT click the roblox icon (settings) in a game while walking or using joystick. THAT IS WHAT CAUSES THE ISSUE. I know some of you will think ""But it does it when I don't do that,"" It might sometimes, but if you stop doing what i said, it will happen WAYYY less. It is not a problem for me anymore! ........ Roblox is a great game, with many options. 9/10"
107,108,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,5,Kenna Bailey,"Amazing game, 1. it if your team is working on it, I can still play it. 2. I'd love it if you'd add more places to bloxburg and Brookhaven 3. Sometimes my camera will make me go in and out and sometimes when I move the joystick the camera goes with it, please fix it. That's all thank you for taking the time to read this:3"
108,109,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,4,Annika Raman,"This is a great game! SUPER fun! Some games do glitch and lag which i personally find very annoying. This game also allows you to create your own game! This is rated 10 plus but I think it would be great for all ages! You can also chat with ppl from all around the world (and it replaces ""words"" with a #). However, it does make u update every 2 weeks or so, so if you r low on storage it might not be the best. But I tottaly recomend this game!"
109,110,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,5,Veronica Bukoski,"In my opinion, roblox is a great game! I've been playing roblox since 2017 and the game has updated a lot, sometimes it can glitch like for example: you can get stuck in private chat after turning it off, your screen can glitch and when you go to turn it makes it so your screen goes in and out and it's super annoying. But overall, it's a great game, my favorite experience(s) are either Welcome to Bloxburg or Arsenal, I can't choose. But yes, I recommend playing roblox, you would probably like it"
110,111,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,3,Lydia Coleman,"This game is fun but I wish there was challenges that you can do to earn robux and not buy it with real money. And I have experienced a couple of bugs like when I jumped once it won't let me stop jumping and when I get into the game I'm a blocky and it won't change but other then those it's pretty fun! But if you can fix those bugs it would be even more fun:) keep up the good work roblox:D OH and one more thing the ""family friendly chat"" dosent work well.. But other then that it's fun:)"
111,112,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Gabriella McDaniel,"Roblox is a really good game! I really enjoy it! But here a few things that bug me on mobile sometimes. 1 lag. sometimes it can lag so bad that I get kick out or that I can't play the game in general. 2 the camera. It's so annoying when im playing a game when all of a sudden my camera get a stuck that I can't move it, the only way for me to fix it is by rejoining the game which please fix it. 3 the new oof sound. I get it and why it changed but did have to be the uh sound please change the sound"
112,113,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,4,Cupcake :0,I really really love thus game because I can stay in touch and play with my friends. The only two problems is the lag and whenever you try and swipe to the beginning of like a group chat or try and scroll down the chat list it stops. And a suggestion would be to add a feature to see who unfriends you (and or why (optional). And it randomly sends friend invites when I don't even send it to them?-
113,114,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,sherri price,"For the most part its a good game, it's very interactive and it can be very fun as there is a large selection of games you can choose from. You can also make many friends and customize your avatar, or sometimes make a game, not on mobile though. My only problem is when you play on mobile sometimes it glitches and zooms in to where you can't zoom out and its hard to move."
114,115,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Rufino Sanchez,"I love this game, so much, but there is bugs, like with the new ui. You'll just yap it and then tap a button to close it then suddenly its stuck on your screen not allowing you to move. It gets stuck in just the right amount to allow you to not do anything pretty much. It's extremely annoying. The only way I've found to get rid of it is to just leave whatever game you were playing then come back to it. But sometimes you make to much progress jn a game to just leave, please fix this, thank you."
115,116,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,A marcotte,"You can make so many new friends and play different varieties of games from horror to role-play to parkour! Although, the updates involve a large amount of storage space and the games seem to glitch more that expected. I would appreciate it if these problems weren't as bad as they are now, but I have come to a conclusion that this is a fun app. 😄👍"
116,117,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Mara Matlock,"This game is really fun to play with your friends! You can do so many things and your unstopable. Only thing thats bad is it can be vulgar sometimes sadly, but if you stay away from that your good! 5 out of every ten times I try to open the app on computer, it shuts down and says the app cannot be opened. But the other five times it works perfectly fine."
117,118,2022-06-12,2022,06,12,4,Vilxa,"Roblox is awesome and all and I definitely recommend but like sometimes I have issues within the game while playing mobile for example Royal high it keeps kicking me out/Glitching 25/8, Also with other games it's super slow most of the time when it comes to loading the home page and it takes a while to join a game without waiting like 2 minutes, But overall it's a really decent game just wish they could fix some of the bugs and issues on mobile devices. Thank you if you read this!!!"
118,119,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,FoxieTheDarkDemon,"I love the game, been playing it since 2017. It does have some issues like the game crashing or freezing on Xbox. When I used to use the Xbox One X, it would run, no crashes or freezing happened to me before but now with the Xbox One Series X, it wants to do that in certain games. I don't know if it's the games that I played on Roblox or if it was actually Roblox itself but if it's Roblox, please fix the issue"
119,120,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,4,Serenitylol,"This game is really fun! I love it I've been playing since 2016 and the games are still great. One problem I do have though is when I tryed to change my password for my account and pressed the send button for the reset message it never sends me it through email or phone, so unfortunately i couldn't log back into my account, please fix that."
120,121,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,5,Allyson Escobar,"This game is Great, Although i think i need some changes for this game. First of all, The Icon Before all of the friends you Have, you should move it to the bottom/Menu thing. And when a join a game, The joystick doesnt work, And My screen Locks (Sometimes). But these Flaws are just mistakes, Please dont take this seriously. But After all, This is still a great game. You should try it out. :)"
121,122,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Iker Cantoran,"This app is basically the only app on my phone (And my touchscreen chromebook) I rate it 4 stars, though, because 1: the camera Mostly ALWAYS glitches. I either can't move the screen or it when on mobile, i cant move. all the screen does is move in and our, in and out. and it forces me to restart my phone and even sometimes reinstall the app! 2: sometimes, reports DONT work. 3: it mostly always sensors words that are spelt wrong, so you sometimes can't say a spelled wrong word. That's all!! 😁👍"
122,123,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,3,Bianca Grageda,"love the game but i wish there was a setting so you could control the size and placement of your controls(jump button, etc.) i have a bigger phone(google pixel 6) and the jump button is way too small and out of place and i miss the button half of the time. theres also an issue with the joystick sometimes when you accidentally click something or click out and go back into the game and you barely move, your camera view is tied to your joystick's movement, only way to fix it is to leave and rejoin."
123,124,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Lailah Spurlin,I love this app! Very fun for ages 5-15... Does glitch sometimes even when I have full bars! So you can't really play a certain game for more than and your or it'll be slow... It's really fun and I really recommend!!!! Also it blocks you from saying bad things so it's not inappropriate AT ALL WHATSOEVER!!! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!!
124,125,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,5,da pwo oof,"The best metaverse there is! While there is lag it runs surprisingly well on my 60$ tablet, the only exception is in bloxton hotels, but on meepcity it can easily run every player! The only games that crash sometimes come from fast movement or objects taking up all 2gb of ram, but other than that, you could probably play this on a potato in 2009"
125,126,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,PL,"It's ok. I changed it to a 4 star because it's rlly good, but when they delete the clothing you bought with robux, it just takes up a slot in your storage and it doesn't even give you your robux back. It also won't let me get rid of the terms & agreements screen even though I read it and clicked agree. But overall its super good! I recommend this game :)"
126,127,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,5,Elk sisters,There's been an issue where the camera will go wacky and it makes it very very hard to play and you usually have to leave or reset to fix it. Another thing is the game will crash for days on end and it always scares me. Finally I've had an issue with the chat where the keyboard won't pop up or take a painfully long time to load or it takes long to show your chat.ALSO RBLX STOP SHOVONG RTHRO DOWN OUR THROATS. NO ONE LIKES IT. But other than that it's FANTASTIC!!!
127,128,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,XxcloudydaysxX,"You can create games,chat,get robux to change avatar, and play different types of games! Its really fun I perfer you playing roblox! But why did I put 4 stars? 1. it locks at random times so when i try to look around I zoom in or out and sometimes you can look at who's playing then exit and its normal again but it doesn't happen with all games its frustrating and it's bugging me alot because I usually have to leave the game and lose my progress! 2. there is online daters! Nasty get rid of them!♡"
128,129,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,taylor Christy,"I've been playing this for years, It's really great! I love how much they put into it. I hate how everyones rating it 3s or 4s because the bugs, It doesn't happen often. Please just respect how much they put into roblox. The zoom in and out glitch is everyones problem, Like I said ""It doesn't happen often"". Just rate it 5. Don't worry about the bugs. Please:)"
129,130,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,3,Juniper Talley,"This is a wonderful game, but you really need to fix the controls on chromebook and on phone. Whenever I go to chat on my chromebook, my screen always lights up and blurs, and it is only fixable if I leave and rejoin, but it will still be there if I decide to chat again. ALSO- please update your skin tones! As a half black, half-white person there is not a skintone that fits me well at all. Other than that, it's a pretty awesome game!"
130,131,2022-07-03,2022,07,03,4,Katarina Corley,"Overall fun game, a lot of variety. You need robux for some things but not to an overly frustrating amount, it's still fun for free. However, there are a lot of glitches/bugs throughout the entire app, especially on mobile, that often are frustrating. No ads which is nice."
131,132,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Jamie M,"I love Roblox. It's a great game and there's so many things you can do! (it's the only game that has a decent horse riding sim) I really enjoy it but there are some bugs that haunt me constantly. Sometimes, I try to change my camera, it only zooms in and out! Also sometimes I try to move, but every time I use the joystick the camera view goes crazy. There is one other bug that I don't have enough room to talk about, but overall it is a great game! GREAT for kids, save for the occasion bullies!"
132,133,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Gloworm -,"Really fun, but sometimes it glitches. Specifically when I'm listening to music bluetooth and playing a game same time. In general though, sometimes it just kicks me out of games for no reason. It shows up as an ""internet issue"" but my internet is fine and the game was running smoothly at the time."
133,134,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Juan Reese Peña,"Best expirience I have had in years. The games and servers provided fit me so well sometimes. So much so I got addicted to one of the games for a little bit until I finished the entire game! LOL But anyway, having played this game for prob. a year and a half now... I only got 230 robux total. 😂 Reason being that it's 4 stars not 5 is as a lot of other reviews say, there is glitches. One problem I found a neusance was the roleplay games and a certain glitch. The game also crashes."
134,135,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Itz_ Llamaberry,It's a great app with many games but sometimes it glitches and kicks me out even if my wifi is great. It also sometimes glitches when I play with friends. I would also like to point out that sometimes it says the same experience launched from a different device. I have changed my password so many times and have never given it to anyone. I think it might just be a glitch but it gets super annoying sometimes.
135,136,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Morgan Bosworth,"This game is Awesome, but EVERY SINGLE TIME it tells me to update it... it doesn't let me, when I have zero apps, it still doesn't let me. And it's also weird bc for certain games such as ""Natural disaster"" it tells me to play like how you text on your phone... yeah straight up and no sideways (yes I play on phone) its also weird bc when your in the middle of a game that doesn't save your progress, it disconnects you... 😵 and sometimes it's just laggy and buggy, like the game brookhaven!"
136,137,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,5,Khloe Spranza,"Overall I've played for a longggg time and I love it! It's a great way to socialize with your friends during the summer, BUT there is an issue with this game. Firstly, on a game([TRAIN] Spray paint, I believe), whenever I play this game it gets REALLY LAGGY my screen stops and freezes. please fix it!"
137,138,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,Aarah Burroughs,"This game is overall good! But I do have a few issues. 1. When im on mobile sometimes my screen randomly just zooms out and i also cant walk in-game while thats happening. 2. In the catolog, are when you search can we please have the catagories still be there? It's quite annoying when you're trying to search for a classic shirt and a bunch of the layered clothing come up! 3 (this is optional). Roblox should also add different color theme for the backround of the home page! Thats all :) tyy!"
138,139,2022-07-12,2022,07,12,5,Miss Opinion,"This game is awesome! But I have experienced issues like frozen or first person third person view issues, jumping timing and toxic people. Please fix these problems if you can. I play on mobile so I understand if the problem is mobile play and need to play on computer to fix these issues (most of them)but if you can,fix the issues please. 4 stars since the avatars choices are endless, have millions of games to play so I can find the perfect one,and is free."
139,140,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Natalie Morris,"I love this game, it's great. But there it a problem. There is this bug that happens when playing roblox on mobile. That bug is that when you are playing your screen will lock and you can only zoom in or out. I hate when that happens and I do hope that finds a way to fix that. I hope you found this helpful. To whoever is reading this Be safe and Have a nice day"
140,141,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Robloxlittle sister 5,"The games great and all, But as a mobile player I stumble into some screen bug that can ruin an entire sence. Most games don't do this. But many others but the screen when I either turn and accidentally open settings, and then my screen bugs out and either it forces me to zoom in or out, or just freezes the entire screen. Overall this game is great! But please can you fix this annoying bug?"
141,142,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,5,echozia,"It very fun and I have played it for entire years, the excessive amount of user made games with every genre, fandom, and Everything else. You can find almost anything here while most of the games aren't that fun to play your basically guaranteed to find a good game that you can play for days on end, Roblox also doesn't bombard you with ads for every time you move the screen, but their are in-app purchases that you can use to stylize your character and give you a little boost in the games."
142,143,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Oneka Delancy,"It's good but just wish shift lock were on every device. BUT STILL WHY PAY FOR ROBUX with real money?This game is fun but unfair and there should be more free stuff in the shop,there's a glitch. If your move your camera and you accidentally press the menu button, it locks your camera and you can't even go side to side and up and down, Pls fix. And I think all people should be able to create!"
143,144,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,3,Jackson Han,"As some one who's been playing for 6 years on pc, I wanted to try out the mobile version just for the fun of it, but it has so many problems! Like when I was playing some of my favorite games,they simply wouldn't load or the whole app would just close and I would lose my progress on the game. Very annoying yet I am hoping for the best that it gets fixed.(tho I still am quite annoyed at the problems it has.)"
144,145,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,5,James Baugher,It's very good just that they don't fix many mobile glitches. Like if you move the screen and accidentally open the top left menu (this happens all the time) you can't turn your screen and have to rejoin to get rid of it. This affects games that reset progress like a lot of tycoons.
145,146,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,5,Danielle Weed,"Exceptional game! It's online so you can talk to real people and not bots. You can friend people and join them and play together in games. There is so many games you could not count it, everyday more than 1 game is made. You can also create your own games! Along with creating avatar items. You can make you avatar anything you want! And if the adds look fun then your in luck! Because they don't even put the best games in them. I would also like to give credits to Bloxburg and Brookhaven++"
146,147,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Abigail McCaffery,"Roblox is a great game, I play it almost everyday. There's a million different games to play and there's always an option for you. I recommend trying this game. Although there are some flaws with it like on mobile sometimes when you're playing a game it only let's you zoom in or out and you can't look around and sometimes when you buy a clothing item it becomes unavailable after a week which is stupid, maybe what they need is a refunding system for avatar items but overall this game is great."
147,148,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,3,Olivia Johnston,"This game used to be a really good game with few bugs, and you could customize your avatar however you wanted too. Now if I press the jump button for too long, it stays stuck, when if your walking for too long your joy stick will make you keep going in that direction. The worst bug is your Perspective, when I jump and accidently open the menu, my Perspective on the screen is stuck on where it was before, and makes it harder to play. I hate the hair update too. 😒"
148,149,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Midi,"I think this is a really good game :)! I just think we should be able to delete our accessories and get the robux back. Also, whenever you report someone it dose not work. like once this person kept cussing at me in a game so i decided to report them but that didnt do anything. And it takes up a BUNCH of space on my chromebook. I have this problem where im not able to move my screen :(. But besides that, its a great game :)."
149,150,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,5,Yamper Yorshire,"Best of the best, it is one of the few games I've actually paid for and after years, I finally gave into the monthly subscription and it is completely worth it. You get a far better deal doing the subscription rather then paying everything up front. Bloxburg is a great game to grind and it has a multitude of roleplay, tycoon, obby, and simulator games that is bound to keep you or your child occupied for hours!"
150,151,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,5,Juliana Wendt,"This app is very fun and entertaining, this app is just an app where people (who have certain devices) can create games and clothing to allow others to play and create their character. To create a character, most clothing, hair, accessories, etc. are robux which you get from buying gift cards and stuff like that. There are many people who you can interact with and make friends, I have made many friends but I have made a zoom call and hung out with 2 of them, very good way to make online friends"
151,152,2022-07-12,2022,07,12,5,Chyanne Lindquist,"I have had amazing experiences with roblox! since 2018 I have loved this game, before then I wasn't really interested, now I figured I would finally give a review. The only problem I have had and still do have is when i'm playing, it's really slow sometimes and I think it might be my device because I play on a laptop. I thought it was wifi but it can't be because I have used other people's good wifi and I still have the same problem. Other than that this is my very top choice!"
152,153,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,3,Drizzle_Reign,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy playing the different optional games, it's very addictive and fun. Where it's no longer fun is after I die more than two times during a game my character becomes uncontrollable. Whenever I try to move, their movements and the game viewing is like one, I try to move my character foward, I'm looking towards the ceiling for some reason. It's very annoying and makes getting through obstacles difficult. Also hitting reset character, does absolutely nothing. Please fix."
153,154,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Hasna Ridha,"Roblox is an awesome game, you can play with friends on different servers. But why i gave this 4 stars is because of 2 ""bugs"" that happens literally all the time. The first one i a bug that happens in servers. Everytime i did a jump after 3 jumps, my joystick and my screen can't be controlled. The second one is about the app stopping. It would show my ping, cpu, memory, etc on my screen. My phone storage is absolutely fine, but the bugs keeps happening. I hope you can fix it. Thank you."
154,155,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Bradley Clive L. Oliva,"The games pretty fun because you can play a wide variety and games and such and you can customize your avatar pretty freely. The reason I give it 3 stars it of a glitch that has been happening recently, I don't even know how this glitch triggers but sometimes the camera would just stay stuck or it would just keep on zooming in and out if I wanna move it left or right. It's really annoying and it mostly happens when I just got into the game. I hope they fix this because it makes games unplayable."
155,156,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Urako Sutaraito,"It's a great game,and I play it everyday. But the problem I face is that sometimes I get stuck with a zoom in/out glitch, I'm not sure if it only happens with me but whenever I try to move my camera(left,right,down or up)the camera gets zoomed in/out instead,and I have to rejoin. Another glitch that I have experienced is when I try to walk the camera view changes,for example,if I'm trying to walk forward the camera would keep moving to the left or right,it's so annoying,please fix these!"
156,157,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,3,Greg Hurney,Excellent app. Amazing selection of games. Sometimes glitches happen which can be very annoying because you have to rejoin the game I hope you fix this. One time I tried to log in but it wouldn't work so I had to create a new account. That was very annoying all my progress was lost. I tried sending the password to my email and my phone but it wouldn't work so I contacted them but it wasn't successful.
157,158,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,Faith Murombedzi,"I love this game so much.you can hang out with friends and make friends. But there are two problems. The first problem is I have to update it every day. Uninstalling it then reinstalling it takes less time than updating it. Problem two is that recently when I want to play it instantly disconnects me. Please fix these problems. other than those problems,this is a great game."
158,159,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Jhadren Lark Dela Cruz,"Good app! I usually go here whenever I'm bored! 3 stars? I actually experience lag on games and even when the main menu when you open Roblox, it's also hard for the transitions to show because sometimes they're aren't synced. Also, whenever I play in a mobile, a pointer keeps popping out and it completely makes my menu to laptop layout GUI and it's really annoying. I think this is a bug."
159,160,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Mwandama,"This app is amazing!!!! Just one thing... when it says reconnect, it'd be better if we rejoin the same server not another.. and sometimes I randomly can't move my screen. It will only zoom in and out and when I try to walk like that the screen will move down and it would only show the avatars feet.. and a recommendation please listen to reports people are really mean and you don't do anything about it. Overall this is the best app on my phone <3"
160,161,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,2,boji250,"In my opinion the thumbstick is too small. I think the same with the jump button. I wish there was a setting that allows you to adjust the size of the jump button and thumbstick. I also find the camera movement very annoying, making it so if I don't have my finger on the screen for a second or so, it follows where I go. The lag in some games makes sense, giving it's on mobile, but even smaller games lag. I don't think my phone's the problem, since it's new. Roblox on PC is a better experience."
161,162,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,AquaFxric YouTube,"This app is amazing! You do not know how fun it is. It is a game and inside of it there is many mini games to play! Such as breaking point, adopt me, brookhaven etc... The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars is because sometimes I am exiting something and while it is loading it just freezes and I have to restart the app. If you could fix it that would be good. Stay safe everybody bye!"
162,163,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Georgia Monaghan,"It has games for all different age groups and its my favourite gaming platform at the moment. If there are some games you don't like there is going to be twice as many games you will like on here. All my friends play it and love it just as much as me. Lots of people I know that play it are really picky about what games they want play but there are tons of games in here that they love. Althpugh there are problems. Sometimes your screen freezes and you can only zoom in and ou, its really glitchy."
163,164,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Nathan Ngan,I think that Roblox is a very good game but it sometimes bugs out like as of right now it's glitching and my phone is telling me that there is a bug when I try open the app. I gave it a four because it's a very entertaining game to play and I especially like to play bedwars as it's fun to play and with friends. I would've given it a 5 if they fix all the bugs and errors that occur. 😄
164,165,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,2,lealimawhsha,"enjoy playing it, but what i hate is when for those mobile players. They experience a lot of bugs, like the screen only zooming out/in or the screen aint rotating, and plus the mobile having no ability to use shift lock is so unfair. Maybe add a shift lock in the lower area of screen or put a ""shift lock - on/off"" in settings. Plus the new server update rly annoys me a lot."
165,166,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Lukas Jurva,"It's a great game, however, everything I go to profile, groups, private servers, etc, it is zoomed in and sometimes when I try to rotate my camera it just zooms in, other than that it's a great game, it's just that there are some bugs. I'd like for them to be fixed. Edit: It's fixed for me now. Except for when I rotate my camera it still zooms in and out. Please fix this!"
166,167,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Andrea Luna,"Great game! Its just that i get stuck on shift lock a lot lately, and chat filtering and moderation is not the best, but not the worst, it makes it hard to communicate to others, other than those its a great game to hang out with friends! :) Edit: the new sound is pretty bad :/ but i just gotta deal with it i guess.. But I do get why you are removing it and replacing it with a new one😢🤨"
167,168,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Zobia Ansar,"this game is very cool! I can play with my friends and family but I only have one issue with this app, Whenever I play any game on it, my camera doesn't work and doesn't turn around or changes its direction, for example: if I'm playing murder mystery and try to turn around to see if anyone's behind me, my camera doesn't work and than I also can't look forward. I would like this game more if this bug is fixed, nevertheless I love this game no matter what."
168,169,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,soapyydishwasher,"I absolutely love this game! I can play mutiple fun exciting games with my friends, or by myself. But there's an irritating problem on mobile, sometimes my screen will freeze In a game. I can still move around but my screen isn't able to move which makes it harder to play. I can only fix this by triggering a cutscene, or literally just leaving. Hopefully this is something easily fixable, I made a lot of progress on a game, and then it froze and I had to leave. It was really annoying, please fix."

There are so many sets of games and I really am interested into all of them. Not to mention to graphics, max graphics looks amazing, even with the copy and pasted surroundings. I had no problems with this (well sort of) the only thing I'm concerned about is the robux system. I mean, I know you need money, I totally understand, but I think that the items should be a bit cheaper. But I'm glad that it gives you free items!"
170,171,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,ye cheng chiang,"This game is really fun, a lot of fun games created by other players to choose to play. But Roblox, i suggest you to fix some control bugs like stucked screen, I can't look around anymore if that happens, plus, it needs improvement. I would also like to see dpad in the control options. And for the mobile users some games are laggy and some don't, so if you can, please make it so i can lower my graphics even more, I don't care if I can't see the textures anymore all i want is good game experience"
171,172,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,KT,"My review for roblox: First, It's safer! You can disable settings to make sure your kids don't chat to strangers. Second, it doesn't lag as much as it used to. And third, It is very fun. One BIG problem I have with roblox, is that when I press the escape key on my computer, and keep it for a long time, when I move my mouse, it moves with it. I do NOT like that because if I want to do something or I haven't saved something, I leave the game and lose progress. 🙃 Please fix this issue! 4 stars :)"
172,173,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,sunshine,"let me tell you, I've played roblox for 2 years now. And what I loved most about it was personailizing your own avatar! But now since the new update it isnt as easy to get hair combos I love making them. If you can, Please add it back, I'm not the only one who wishes this also. other than that everything is great, I don't recommed playing on a chromebook because it confuses with mobile and pc, so that may be a problem. I dislike this update very much, I own many hair combos."
173,174,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,2,Gyro Jumaday,"Too many bugs and glitches. This game is one of the best games ever. However, it's unfair on how usually mobile players always get bug and glitches. Like recently there was a bug where when you're playing a game your pov freezes, you cant slide ur camera to the left or right. But now I'm glad it's fixed. And now there's a new bug where it usually affects tower defense games. Whenever u need to teleport to a match it always say it fails to teleport cause of our connection even though its fine."
174,175,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,EMPIRE LY,"I loved the game , it has a lot of options and games , but there's only one problem, it needs more quality while playing like moving easily and the other players can walk with me without seeing someone so far away or someone walked so fast because he stopped for reconnecting and when he re-connect he get so far away. I hope that you can fix this so the will be the best game ever , and thank you"
175,176,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Brett Browning,"My experience is totally great, loads of games to play and onlie chat. But the things I don't like is the constant disconnecting that stops you from playing. The other thing I don't like is where there are tags that stops you from talking to friends properly. I understand the tags are here to stop other people from saying bad things, but Roblox has let it go a little bit too much. But overall I think the game is great in many ways and it's a great way to connect with friends online."
176,177,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Tahlia Trantino,"It's a great game. U can 0lay with friends and chat with other people. The only thing that's kinda annoying is that there is al2ays at least 1 or 2 hackers in the game. But roblox can't really fix that can they. So without hackers it would still be a great game. I haven't experienced any bugs or glitches so far, same with technical issues. So yeah, this is a great game and I recommend playing it👍👍👍👍👍"
177,178,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Alyson Bonenfant,"Awesome game! But two issues; I lag a LOT and pretty much nothing fixes it (though its not that bad for certain games), and I'd love if you could add like a selecting system for your friends list. It would make it a LOT easier to remove friends from your 190+ friends who are like never online. Other than that, awesome work! Edit: forgot to say thank you for wishing me a happy birthday, even if it was weeks ago :)"
178,179,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,4,Dieforganqing,"The gameplay is acceptable although they have to put a control customization, the button are small and the positioning is not good for mobile players as it is placed on the corner screen of my phone. The censorship system too. I also came across this bug where the camera gets stuck at a certain angle, it often happens when i take a screenshot. Hope this gets fixed soon. Aside from that, the game is good, really fun with all the game choices and I love the character customization."
179,180,2022-06-03,2022,06,03,3,•Hope•,"So first, I am going to talk about bugs. Sometimes when I turn my screen, it activates the movement of walking. Please fix this because this is very frustrating and also when I turn my screen, sometimes it zooms in. And for the update, I hate to say this but I don't like it, I want the old one back. Like the 2018 stuff. Making it more realistic is kind of the reason why I would quit. But thank you for all the hard work <3"
180,181,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,2,nrlizh,"It was a good game if the bugs are fixed. There's just too many bugs in this game. 1. The screen zooming bug. Whenever I was playing, the screen would bug and I cant move my screen. It will just zoom in and out. Sometimes it would be the opposite. So many people complained about it and had the same problems. 2. Everytime I opened shop and want to search things, the items I searched wont pop up and instead unrelevant items would pop up. Its so annoying."
181,182,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,2,Chrisuiel,"It's a good app with all types of game. Although, I have a few problems. First, the camera always gets broken, such as being to control it properly or being stuck. Then, the search sytem. Whenever I search for a specific game, numerous unrelated games pop up in the results, sometimes even going first. Events are also turning into grinds which is exhausting. Lastly, almost anything gets censored all the time especially if it's in another language. It's such a hassle trying to communicate."
182,183,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,4,Rave Taneo,"such a nice game, but so many bugs. You need to fix this as soon as possible mostly in mobile players. ;Sometimes your screen cannot be turn around. When you're swiping it's just zooming in and out. ;My screen will freeze for 10 sec, then when it start moving it will just shake so much. It's not a phone problem. It's the game. I've seen so many people experiencing this"
183,184,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,5,Hiba,"First of all, this is a great game! It has lots of fun & experiences, BUT😶.. it has a lot of bugs and glitches. An example is when you press on your device screen with 3 or more fingers it doesn't let you look around, you can only zoom in and out. Theres many more glitches but it would take me forever to explain soo... roblox is good bUT I hope it improves! 😍😀"
184,185,2022-06-12,2022,06,12,3,2DAY,"It's a great game, pretty much the games inside Roblox are very fun. Different genre types and more. However there are alot of problems. That being the chat filter, game bugs and alot more. Also, i would really appreciate it if you added a rendering distance option, instead of the graphics quality option. As someone with a low-end PC, this makes my whole game crash or freeze. Although all of these problems, i still find it enjoyable and fun! This game is one one of the best games Ill ever play!"
185,186,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,5,Noob,"There are many games in this platform, and although some games like obbies are frustrating, they taught and trained me never to give up and continue (I still rage and give up sometimes, but occasionally). But there are things that need an improvement like chat censor filters. Overall, I think this is a very good platform, because not only do you have fun at playing the games, you also learn good values like I did. I would give this a 5-star rating and I would definitely recommend it. 👍"
186,187,2022-06-12,2022,06,12,5,Nikolai Courtney,"An amazing game! Thus there is a few problems that is needed to be fixed, I mean.. Every game has its own problem, even the best games too, which is this, the number one problem is that 1) THE CAMERA, sometimes when I try to look around, the camera zooms in, zooms out or neither ( do not move) which is sometimes really frustrating since I need to RE-JOIN to be able to move my screen perfectly fine... That is the only problem I've have observed nonetheless the game is all and amazing! :))"
187,188,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,1,DanLawRex,"I'd like to report a problem I am experiencing in a very long time 'til now, which I find very frustrating. I encounter this control issue whenever the game lags a bit, which happens most of the time. To be more specific, if I get fps drops, I am unable to swipe my screen to look around. At the mean time, I am only able to fix this problem by leaving and rejoining, which is not an ideal and a right solution if playing with friends. Aside from this, I enjoy the game pretty much. Please fix this."
188,189,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,3,no,"I really love the game! Been playing since 2015, but the pointless updates are really annoying. Like for example the servers? It looks so complicated, not simple like it used to. Even removing the ""location"" button on the settings? I am trapped in servers where I cant even understand anyone. I hope you can fix the problems here can bring it back as it used to."
189,190,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,Rakshit Agarwal,"Decent graphics, everything is fine, but there are a few problems 1. It lags a lot if I enter like a shooting game it feels like it is going to crash my game. 2. Sometimes I can't control my own character. 3. It takes to much internet to play , I did like a recharge of 6 GB of internet and just gone in two days. Overall excellent game ."
190,191,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Gigglys RBLX,"It's an amazing game but there's a lot of glitch's while playing in mobile. When I play a game, sometimes there would be an annoying glitch, it will go zoom in and out instead of rotating which happens often. And another where is the screen will be stuck, you can move but the screen will be stuck like that. It's very annoying and I have to rejoin the game!! Roblox please fix this.."
191,192,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,4,Melody Cardeno,"Good game, GREAT GAME!! Been playing for 7 years now and so far haven't had any major issues aside from crashing, lag, and roblox down. But on mobile, for some reason my screen is zoomed in whenever I go to someone's profile or try to buy robux, etc. It's normal on the homepage though. I'm not sure how to fix it, I've reinstalled it several times and I can't find anything on the internet."
192,193,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,4,Chrome Man,"It's a good game, my bad, set of games. However I would recommend making a more wide variation of choices on the games, and to make an offline mode to play games truly anywhere, and anytime. The offline mode is simple, basically private servers with friends joining off, and a saving system. Anyways great game, and I am looking forwards to how you will improve it."
193,194,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,4,Ram Jessan Llamas,"I really recommend this game to people that has a huge imagination and creativity, the only thing is, as a mobile user, there's a bit problem it's because there is some tiny pixels all around the places, it's a bit sad that I can't feel the high quality of the game and the smoothness out of it, I use some gaming cleaning apps and it helped me a bit, but it doesn't change the tiny pixels, I would recommend that one of these problems is being fixed and focused the most for mobile users."
194,195,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Claire Whittaker,"Overall one of if not my favourite games ever, there is always a fun game to find and you can play 100s maybe even 1000s of great games to play and speed through time playing many different games. The one bad thing about the game is with the robux cards, when i put the right things in to log in on google it says it isn't correct, i would love if you put the cards system on the actual app so that you can be logged in and do it very quick. This isnt much of a problem and it is an incredible game"
195,196,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,{{ Cherry Blossoms }} [[ Gerbera Daisy ]],"Hello! I just want to tell you that Roblox is such a good game, It has lots of good games! But there's a problem to updating the app, whenever I try to do it, a message pops up and says ""Error, try again. If it doesn't work find other ways to solve the problem."" And also sometimes a glitch happens and you can't move but all you can do is some in and out, plus sometimes when I open roblox everything is a empty loading screen so I hope you can fix it for us."

197,198,2022-07-16,2022,07,16,4,Muhammad Mustafa,"The game is really fun. Theres a lot of games which are exciting. Theres two problems that i cannot always solve, the first one is the screen glitch. Whenever i swipe it doesn't turn or it will just freeze. The second problem is that it quickly made my storage full which will make me automatically leave a game, and it wouldn't load for a while. Thanks for entertaining us Roblox community!"
198,199,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,4,Ann !,"It's an amazing game! I will recommend this to people who would like to install this game. I have two reasons why I rated it a 5*; first, it sometimes loads slow when you click a game. It would say reloading (#) and it would exceed 20, it's very irritating. And for last, when you try to move your screen it would zoom in or zoom out your screen. This only happens sometimes, but it would appear when I'm in a serious situation in the game. It is very raging when this happens. So far, it's okay."
199,200,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,2,-Rio Chakuro-,"I like the game very much but being in mobile in this game is somehow hard. The jump button is way too small and if I can, I wanna request for custom settings so we can change the size of the jump button and change the size of the thumb joystick kind of thing, so a custom UI in short. It's just a suggestion though! cam glitch sucks"
200,201,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,5,Daria Dyl,This game is so entertaining for me and all my friends! This could keep us busy all day and it's crazy to think that it's free! There a multiple games you can play in the app and make tons of new friends. There's no advertising either. There are so many gameplay opportunities such as role-playing to a hard earning simulator... The game options are endless. Most games are available to play on all devices. You have the feature to customize and perdonalize your own character. Highly recommend 5/5
201,202,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,The Cooks,I love this game soooo sooooo much the only thing i can say is that sometimes the controls go a bit funny and it takes ages to load when u want a new game but it might be different for u. But it does make up for it as there are so many types of features to you avavter! One of my favourite things to do with these games is the variety of different challenges and characters!
202,203,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Aaren Hayley Xzechkaira Alfeche,"It is a very nice game but there are glitches in the game especially in mobile, it is very hard to control sometimes because of glitches.. please fix this... But I still like this game. But yet 3 stars? The glitches all the time even my signal strength is Excellent yet it always shows me a black screens all the time and i couldn't leave! It even freezes and i couldn't do anything just leave the app! I'm so sorry i was just frustrated:( please fix this..!!!"
203,204,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Jelo Agustin,"I have problems: The new UI is cool but everytime I clear my cache, it goes back to the old ones, & When the ""OOF"" Sound was replaced by the ""TAAH"" Sound & when I reinstalled Roblox, The ""TAAH"" Sound is not working anymore. Tried to reset the app & the ""TAAH"" Sound is still not working. & One more. When I switched to another game after I play a game which has shift lock, the other games are also on shift lock & When looking left & right, it just zoom my screen. Hope you fix this. Thank you 😊"
204,205,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,xxYour Local Dragonetxx,"Its a nice game in general but there are some problems I encountered while playing. • In mobile when I try to turn the camera it either freezes in place or the game just crashes. • When I open the game it freezes on the loading screen and I have to restart my device to make it work. • There are many glitches when I try to enter other games. That's all the problems I have encountered, but overall the game is still very good and I recommend playing it."
205,206,2022-06-12,2022,06,12,5,Ellie Milne,"It is super amazing with the ability to play other people's games and make your own. It also has a wide range of games from very creative developers. It has some realistic features ( RThro) but the style of things are so simple and unique. Overall, only the occasional errors are bad but I would really reccomend downloading it. In addition, being able to purchase the online currency, robux, means it is free to play most games and make a good avatar. This means ads are optional to watch. 5 stars!"
206,207,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,5,Kyle Roberts,I personally think that Roblox is one of the best games I ever downloaded! It can be frustrating at times as I sometimes accidently exit the app and then it glitches and makes it so I can only move and zoom. Other than that it is amazing! It's fun and time consuming and there are so many amazing things to do. Personally my fav one is daycare story. I hope that if you download this app you enjoy it as much as me. It is also ad free and hope this is helpful!😁
207,208,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,3,Stephen Patterson,"I love this game very much. This is the best game on my phone, iPad and computer. There is one game that someone made, that it's just very realistic. Which is, Royale high. There is gamepasses that cost robux, there is nothing that is vip and it's free. But one problem, it disconnects when I'm in the middle of something, like, when I'm doing something with someone and I haven't friended them as yet. Also, it shows a black screen and goes back to the home screen. Please fix this problem."
208,209,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,Farhana Supti,"I love this game a lot but there is some bugs. 1 - whenever i play a game for a hour straight my camera starts glitching. It can get fixed if i rejoin the game and im not sure if its my device (i play on mobile). 2 - Some words i say in chat get censored for no reason. For example words like ""phone"",""ig"", sometimes ""idk"", etc. words and that are not against the terms of service or inappropriate. Btw if anyone is reading, i would recommend! But i give this a five stars bc it my favorite game."
209,210,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Dyroo,"This is a great game but i only have 2 issues. Please just fix the mouse issue it keeps teleporting after i release right click and the second issue is the graphics not working i keep setting it on high but the textures, lighting, etc, i hope you fix it I'm having a lot of trouble playing with my mouse and keyboard in mobile."
210,211,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,3,Maynard Manager,It says to check your internet 24/7 when it's their servers I'll be on full bars with data and it wouldn't even matter it would still say to check the internet connection. If they expanded the servers this might not happen as much. Also shiftlock on mobile is really glitchy and Every time I use it I get stuck with shiftlock. There is also this glitch where you can't turn you screen without zooming in this happens both on mobile and pc. I would love to rate it higher but I just can't.
211,212,2022-06-17,2022,06,17,4,s1m0n,"Amazing game, my favorite game. Choices are endless, games are all fun (excluding O.D. games) however, the same issue that many people have. Bugs, screen problems etc. etc. For example: ▪ mobile, when you swipe it just continously zooms in and out ▪ also mobile, moving your character makes the screen also move ▪ when you want to chat, you click the chat button but there appears to be no chat. These are my only issues, if you could fix them, i'd rate a 5 star 100% !"
212,213,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Foong Hao yang,"This game is like many games in one compact app. Although you need internet to use the app, it is still a really good game. My only concern is that Roblox is starting to not listen to the community unlike the old one. Even though there are still many glitches like screen glitch which sometimes you can change the type movement or the infinite jumping which you can just click in the menu and out of it and the unguaranteed friendly players, it is still a pretty fun multiplayer game."
213,214,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,3,A Google user,Game is good. Many games to choose from and meet new friends worldwide. But the problems are the display and control. It's a really big problem for me as a robloxian especially when i'm on mobile. There are times where my screen will suddenly freeze and then next thing i know is that i can no longer move my screen but zoom in and out in replace.
214,215,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,5,Jamie M,"This game is really fun! But this is one little problem to me. I do prefer the old clothing even though I do have some of the new clothing (outwear). But with the other clothing like the out wear especially the shoes, it doesn't go very well with the avatars (My opinion). Overall it's a really good game and, I would recommend it!"
215,216,2022-06-19,2022,06,19,3,Alejandra Dione Gener,"I like this game a lot! I can play games, make friends, and customizer my avatar too! But there is one small problem with my experience with it. When I try to type, the letters don't really show up. I also have another problem, when you try to turn your screen around, it just zooms in the character, if you see this. Please fix it and I would rate this a solid 5 star."
216,217,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,5,honeybee,I do love this app alot and i think it is an amazing way to spend your free time but I do think the robux and the items should be a lot cheaper. I have also been experiencing a bug where it won't let me update the game even when I have enough storage too and it keeps kicking me out of the game. Please fix this and i would rate 5 stars :) Totally recommend!
217,218,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,That racoon Guy,"The game has started to go downhill recently, but not that much of an issue, the chat filter has definitely gotten more, let's say strict, sometimes it'll block something you've said even if it's not inappropriate and vice versa, meaning someone could easily say things that are not suitable for this platform. Other than that, it's a decent app that can entertain people of all ages, with its abundance of games it's almost impossible that you'll get tired of it."
218,219,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Alexander Miguel Cabrera,"I Really like this game because of the creativity of the games and the character customization and many other features, i suggest that you add a few more features like ""recently played with"" incase you disconnect or wanna find them and add them, and add shift lock for mobile in the settings to turn on or off incase you dont want it on your screen. Therefore i like the game."
219,220,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,3,Lexi Shadows AJ,"A good app for playing with friends! Unfortunately, theres a few bugs. So first, for some reason half of the time I play a game or check my avatar my clothing has become blurry, when I join a game it does that to everyone clothes. I asked a few of my friends and it doesn't really happen to them, maybe because of my phone but if not please and try to fix it! Second, Everytime I accidentally click the menu by accident, my screen freezes. It's annoying just rejoining everytime."
220,221,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Michelle Ayala,"I love this game so much! I really enjoy playing this game. Theres so many games in this game to try and explore! Although I have a few problems, 1. I can't save any outfits that have the left woman arm. 2. Sometimes the camera gets stuck. 3. Almost anything gets censored for an example ""ok"" gets censored even when you speak in certain languages it censors."
221,222,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,2,Faith Cedo,"hate it when everytime I leave the game it will give a loading screen then will make me log out of my acc then make me log into it again, EVERYTIME. Its also so annoying when in mobile my camera stops moving then freezes, and I have nothing else to do other than rejoin in order to fix it, ofc not the only one that experience It sometimes freezes the screens then shakes it multiple times which makes it unplayable. Oh yea you ""fix"" the game to removes bugs, it doesn't, it only makes it worse."
222,223,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,Morris Chang,"I will rate 5 stars because this game is very fun, I will also die at sometimes but this game has taught me to never give up. I still rage and give up sometimes, but occasionally. But there is an annoying bug on mobile. When I move forward,I am looking at the roof. I will also freeze sometimes. This makes it very hard for obbys. If this bug is fixed I would very much play it every day. But since I am playing on the computer, my mouse will go broken or my keyboard will. Hope you can fix this bug!"
223,224,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,3,yes EVERYWHERE,"great game as always, but flawed with controls and optimization. joystick getting stucked for no absolute reason, camera getting stucked, joystick affecting the camera. aren't getting fixed with no major explanation despite the ""bug fixes"". times where the game simply black screen. the devs needs to fix to have a better gameplay. overall the game is good itself."
224,225,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Bushra ubaid catholic,"Love it, I have another account really good I like it a lot although some games contain inappropriate content like images one of the game is: Rate my avatar, it is mostly not the devs fault but there is a option where you can post an image by having the image's ID so there is inappropriate images in that game. Also another thing is sometime's you're screen can get stuck basically you can still walk but you can't turn you're character so that can get annoying in games so yeah thats it bye!!!!!!!"
225,226,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Gabby1 luke,"I've had this app for 2 years, and I have to say that it's almost perfect. There are lots of games you can play with your friends or just by yourself. The only thing that bothers me about the app is the lag. 4/10 times when I open the app, I'll either get kicked or have major lag when I play a game, and my internet would be just fine. Overall, I would highly reccomend this app."
226,227,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Rpost,"This game is good but, there's a bug that haven't been fixed for too long and this bug is only for mobile players, you see when you play like Tower of hell or any kind of game, when you walk and you accidentally clicked the Roblox icon you cannot control your screen anymore and it will follow your joystick's movement. So that's pretty much it. I hope you will fix this👍"
227,228,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Rudra singh,"This is one of the best games on play store,but I have some problems with it,1:it lags too much, sometimes I feel like the lag is just going to crash the game,2:it take too much internet,I did a 2GB recharge plan,gone in one day,3: sometimes I can't control the player,that's all the problems, other than that this game is good!"
228,229,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Zoey Sercombe,"This is an amazing way to learn so many different things, it is very addictive but it can teach kids a lot. This game should make it's own movie! Glitches do occur randomly and can be stressful, whilst other games in roblox are glitch free. It could make in improvement on being offline without WiFi too!"
229,230,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,3,Rhylee Cortez,"The game is good as it helps people express creativity in game development and avatar creation but theres a very common bug that only affects mobile ports with the camera where the camera would instead be controlled by the joystick, meaning that when i drag the joystick, both my character and the camera moves, causing the camera to lock in place while still being able to zoom in or out, or the camera still gets to roam around my character without it getting locked in place."
230,231,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,sabina drwal,I really couldn't help but agree with any other review. From the games to the friends you can play with. But there is some glitches roblox can fix. Roblox can fix the flying glitch in Brookhaven completely or the glitch that can make you go through walls in adopt me. There are many more I'll like to see fixed. But I think this is a good game and would highly recommend it. Five stars for everything that make this a great game.
231,232,2022-06-04,2022,06,04,5,Tomass Draška,"This is a really good game, but with every good game come glitches. Thankfully, the development team patch and update the physics engine regularly, but there are still many glitches left to patch. One glitch i really want fixed is a render distance bug, which automatically alters the render distance (at lower graphics levels, when it's set to manual) from around 300 studs, to like 5000 studs at random moments, causing lag spikes for lower-end device players. Other than that, it's really good."
232,233,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Leon Delamere,It's a very fun game to play and I like that I get to make virtual friends and I get to play millions of games but I do have some complaints. 1) I don't like that we always have to update it when it should just update by its self. 2) when you are playing sometimes your screen frezzes and then you can only zoom in and zoom out and you have to keep leaving and rejoining the game that you were already on or you can play a different one but other than them its an actual cool game so I recommend it.
233,234,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,5,Gameplayer 30,"Beautiful! I love how the Roblox interface looks! Wonderful! And, also a inprovement, please fix the joystick cuz sometimes when you use the screen too much, when you move, the joystick acts like you look up when you move forward then if you move backward, you look down. Please fix this! But I still love this gaming platform. It is perfect! Bye!!"
234,235,2022-07-16,2022,07,16,3,Jessica,I enjoy playing However there's a few things that I think should be changed. 1) pay for robux: I understand that you need to make money and stuff but tha fact that you don't even start out with anything is annoying. 2) offline mode: having something that's simple and allows people to play in the go would be great and would allow a better access for those who are always on the go. 3) having game save modes: instead of having to restart have a save mode incase someone wants to continue
235,236,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Johnson Fernandes,"I love it! You can play millions of games with friends and even get alot of cool items, The problem is that I keep getting a ""You've been kicked out this game"" or ""Same account logged in on different device"" But ignore that! This game is amazing *not a bot btw* Edit: They also need to add more mobile support car games, and fix a camera bug when you go to the server tabs and return back to the game you can't move your camera or it keeps on zooming in, please fix this I would appreciate it ROBLOX."
236,237,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Anshu Lala,"I love this game! Just one thing that bugs me is that I updated Roblox 1 week ago and it said I need to update it again. It needs quite powerful internet if you want to play. One last thing many people have had issues with, the screen glitch. I reset my character and then it won't let me move my camera. Otherwise, it's a fantastic game, would definitely recommend. 4 stars for now."
237,238,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,3,Stephanie Pedong,"Let's change up, the game isn't perfect, after that ""Big Update"" there were so many bugs and glitches, the one I hate the most is when I can't even move my screen/It zooms in and out everytime I want to move it left and right, another one is the fact I sometimes keep moving when I don't want to, and the only way to stop it is if I open the menu and close it, but there is a chance that the screen gets bugged, and the only way to fix that is if you leave the game, but overall the game is alright!"
238,239,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,abby scharf,"its a great game! i love almost everything about it, except for the layered clothes bug, most of the time when i put it on it lags, especially with the dresses, i think you should look at the dresses and see if they can be fixed."
239,240,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Ruby Hill,"I love this game there is so many servers to join like obbys, mini games, survival games, roleplay and much more. I highly recommend this game no problems for all ages so fun!! :) <3 the only problem is, I spent money for robux on some clothes and after a while they expired due to date or something and then I couldn't wear it anymore other than that the game is very entertaining an it's easy to learn to move the joystick and jump."
240,241,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Princess Chloe Perea,"This game! Yes, this game. I love it that a lot. I've made online friendss!! Now let me tell something. Sometimes I get stuck on shiftlock that it's a bit annoying. For mobile players. The screen always get stuck and sometimes it broke like you're not clicking something that it click itself. Firstly, I got my voice chat today. I saved my email, changed my password, got Roblox Voice Chat and enabled it, then after a few minutes, it got an error. Then it looks like that I cannot use it anymore. :("
241,242,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,4,Shardea Callyn Sagun,"Yes it's wonderful game but sometimes, i experience in other games that when you want it to look around, it will zoom itself adn sometimes, when you are walking, the screen will automatically go down and as you adjusting it, it goes back and it irritates me, but somehow it is a nice game for friends, that's all. Peace ✌️"
242,243,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Raelyn Ayerite,"i love this game, but there is a few glitches that need to be fixed, while your playing the game when you want your screen to turn it just zooms in and out, it doent happen to pc's bc i have one, and the fact that it just freezes for no reason and just kicks you out the game when you have good data/internet with the screen saying loading experince or closing experince then when you get back on it just does a replay after a while kicking you out on mobile but 100% recomend for the readers"
243,244,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Rachel,"Roblox is an great, interacting game! The expierence is also wonderful. But, it takes a long time to load, and when you don't know your password and try to reset it, the email takes about a day to come through just so you can change it. And lastly, some of the people on it aren't fair, but otherwise, great game!"
244,245,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,A Fenning,"I've play for 4 years now and I just think it's fantastic! You can play anything and never get bored! I personally give a 5/5 because it's really fun and I plan on playing for more years to come! My only problem is the robux, you can buy cool things with it. The game is perfect without it, but I hope that the robux clothing could be less and that more clothing for your avatar could become free?"
245,246,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,3,Dayanet Perez,"I'd give it a 5 star because I grew up with this app, but the amount of problems in this app is irritating, let's start with the fact that most of the times for mobile players, when you zoom out or move your character it zooms you in and gets the screen stuck, I think that us mobile players would be more comfortable with the app if it didn't have this issue, this is only one of most problems. Right now it's not letting me enter roblox, this has been going on for 2 days now. Please fix the game."
246,247,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Brayden Mcbride,"This is a very good game, been playing since 2017. But there are a few things that should be changed, starting with the filter in the chat. It tags bad words and that kind of thing, but it also sensors numbers, and words like ""cute"", which can be annoying. And I have had a few incidents where I can't look around, and can only zoom in and out. And sometimes when I move my character it moves the camera too. And I think we should Earn robux for playing games, and not completely buying alone."
247,248,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Olga Dal Toso,"I've been playing Roblox for almost two years now and I've been using it a lot on laptop and on mobile, but in the last months whenever I tried to enter the app on my phone Roblox would shut down after a few seconds and bring me to my mobile's home screen and this would stress me out after a few minutes. Sometimes I can join a game but it disconnects me after a few minutes. I hope this bug/glitch gets fixed."
248,249,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,3,Coral Miranda,"I love Roblox, and it's one of my fav games to play. My favorite game is Wings of Fire and lately everytime I play it, it freezes for like an hour, and then shuts off and when I turn it on again it says something like Error, something about having to restart my account and that means losing the game and everything else I have in my mobile. I have paid for WoF at least 5 times and I can't keep doing that. If it didn't have this annoying problem I would have given this a five star...pls fix this"
249,250,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,chizzy curls,"I've been playing Roblox since 2016. The game is really nice. You can play various games with various genres, customize your avatar, and make new friends. There are only a few problems that I encounter in the game. First, some games make lots of lag that my phone would freeze for minutes. Second, there would be this error thing that the account I am using is also being used by another device, even though no one is using it. Overall, nice game."
250,251,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Kaycel Lumanglas,"It is a great, or good game. but why 4 stars? I would like to explain some things that I am having trouble abt. first, the clothes disappearing, I couldn't see it when I'm in a game!! pretty sure that I'm not lagging or bc of my wifi!! my wifi works pretty well as always!! second, the controller, whenever I'm in a game it always glitches!! pls fix this!!!"
251,252,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Tanis Occean,"Roblox is a pretty good app! It has really good games to download, the only problem I have is the hackers that keep on coming to the game. I'm not 100% sure it's because of the game, but it's still really scary. I myself have never been personally hacked before, but my friends have multiple times on multiple games. One of my friends lost their account to a hacker. Other then that, thus game is perfect! I recommend it! Just add 2-step verification to your account, and you should be fine!"
252,253,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Keira Bagley,It has amazing features and get updates alot. But the only problem is it alway stops working because there a problem or Roblox crashed. And the hackers can be ban. But mostly all of them come back after years that's a huge problem u have to fix and take ages like I could type it comes in tags. By over all it actually really good game many to choose from cheap clothes and display names and chats and friends ice been playing this game for 6 years now and I'm still obsessed
253,254,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,4,Khyle Ethan Opeña,"This is a good game and its very fun, there are some bugs on mobile within the game where your screen glitches out and sometimes when you move your screen moves with you, and sometimes you also cant move the screen so i cant really give it a perfect rating, if you can please fix the bug i would give a perfect rating and be satisfied, this game is very fun and it can inspire people to create their own games though, so the only problem is the glitches on mobile. Please fix it."
254,255,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Aryn Tisdale,"Love the game, super fun- but honestly the screen glitch on mobile is so annoying it makes me want to delete the app. And the technical difficulties arent on my end, I don't know why the pop up. And personally, if you wanted to give robux to people, they really need to make a button. Seriously, doing all that is such a hassle sometimes🕳🚶‍♀️"
255,256,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Cayenne 999,It's fun I just don't like that after you play for a while it gets boring. But other than that everything is good 👍🏻. One more thing is that your online on an open source platform and your talking and playing with all sorts of strangers and you don't even know their age. I find that really problematic regarding younger players who can easily be persuade and put themselves in danger online. They may need to update their COPPA system in general.
256,257,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Lilleplays roblox,I like the game 🎮 its fun you can make online friends add you irl friends and play with them. You can play so many games. You can't play roblox sometimes without an update. The only problem for me is when I get robux it takes a bit to fully charge me. When I get a face or something for my avatar it shows up like 2 or 3 days later. And sometimes I don't know how but it removes my friends and the next day there back so what's with that?!? Over all its a good game 🎮 👏
257,258,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Madelynn Billings,"I absolutley LOVE THIS GAME!!! The cost of robux is reasonable and cheap. I have bought lots of robux the past 6 years I've been playing. One thing I'd like you guys to fix is the shift lock glitch I've been having. I'm on mobile, so when I press the shift lock button, then turn it off, It just stays in shift lock mode. It is pretty annoying, but I know Y'all can fix it! Keep making Roblox the best game ever!!"
258,259,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Lisa Hepworth,"Really great game lots of things to do...the only problem is robux. Other people have great avatars when I am stuck with limited skins it is extremely difficult to find an avatar I am happy with, with only a couple choices all because I refuse to pay money. Apart from that it is so fun to play and is compatible with xbox and mobile I would definitely recommend and have had hours of fun with it"
259,260,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,5,Saoirse Quinn,"The game is very good I would like there to be better servers and not have it crash all the time and less expensive things and not as much robux stuff popping up the whole time, but a very good game my whole family play it and they all say it is very good maybe aswel more content and mini games and other things like that. But a VERY VERY VERY good game. Also if you could I would appreciate it if you fixed the glitching and stuff"
260,261,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Candyce Chatfield,This game is sooooooo much fun like you will love it. But I hate how u have to bye robux! Sometimes it does kind of glitch. And sometimes the screen just walks up and then whenever I try to turn it just makes the screen that go in and out so I have to log off the game and get right back on and it's on a full new map.
261,262,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,5,Haris Kaif,"This is the best game ever! It blew my mind after I was told about it and I even post YouTube videos about it! This game truly powers my imagination, but the games crash. Apart from the game crashing, one improvement they could try to make is to stop the cursor from having a limit while rotating your character while shooting, etc. A solution would be to make the OS recognise Roblox as a full screen game like Minecraft. Thanks!"
262,263,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Jucy World,It's great because there is so many different types of games like if somebody wants to do something they can do it. But there is also some problems with it like when I'm playing a game and after a few minutes I can't look around I can't even soom in or out it is just froze but I can still move ira weird but I hope it gets fixed in the next update. But also now after a small amount of time it will say fheach my wifi connection and my wifi is perfectly fine
263,264,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,ogechi francisca,"I give it 3 stars because sometimes when I put it ,it doesn't turn on and also glitches. Also most of the times when I play brookhaven it says that i am disconnected for absolutely no reason cuz when i check my internet connection it is connected. And sometimes people keep robbing me in games but other than that it is absolutely amazing."
264,265,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,David Glahn,"Amazing game and great experience on my part. There are some really talented creators on Roblox like Platinum Falls and Coeptus. I love the part of the game that it's all up to the community, the community makes the games, and they're usually really good. Overall spectacular app and strongly recommend it to anyone. Edit: I play on chromebook for the current time being, and there is a bug that almost makes it unbearable to play, where some buttons won't do anything, pls fix this..."
265,266,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,3,A Google user,"This game is overall great, but the only reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because of the major issues/bugs. Like when I go to play it on my phone and I have to do the 2 step verifycation it just says error then kicks me out. Another issue is that it kicks me out because of internet connections when I have full bars, sometimes thats very major when you're in a middle of a game. One more major bug is that when it glitches I can't look around. But overall its a pretty decent app, solid 3/5."
266,267,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,Mason Fredell,"I love it it has so many games to choose from, but the rubux is WAY to expensive . There's a lot of glitches and they can slow you down your character but it's okay it goes away like a couple seconds overall the game's really really good I love Brookhaven and everything like that vehicle legend has a lot of bugs but it's very very good overall but I hope you enjoy your game have fun."
267,268,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,3,James Smelcer,"3 stars because roblox is getting better, but this bug on Android has been happening for years now, (no joke) and also on iPhone. As well as Motorola, google, at&t, iPad, Kindle Fire, etc. The bug is that either whenever we try to move the screen, it just zooms in even though nothing else is touching it, or whenever you walk, the screen moves aswell. 𝙋𝙇𝙀𝘼𝙎𝙀 fix this bug, because the only way to solve it is by leaving the game. And most of the games I play don't save. That's all folks."
268,269,2022-06-03,2022,06,03,4,Gerard Gonzales,"Hello Roblox Team! The game is really great and very consistent with it's content and updates, and is very enjoyable to play. I totally would like to propose a control optimization option where you can resize the jump and move buttons and change the positions of the jump ang move buttons on screen since it is difficult to utilize when the pair of buttons in the screen are not very customizable for users like me who have small devices. - From your Regular User :)"
269,270,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,3,Cherry Blowout,"The game is amazing. But ever since I opened it on March or April of this year, the game stays on the loading screen and then says ""connection error"" when my connection is completely fine. Then it never actually loads. The screen just stays like that for a long time and I don't like that. Since this problem is popular, I kindly ask you to fix this."
270,271,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Carly Katz,"This game is amazing and i would give it 5 stars but a problem is sometimes when i reset or zoom all the way in multiple times i can't look to the side or behind me only the way i was looking before this happens. I hope roblox can fix this problem soon! Overall really good game! I would recommend this game to play with friends. edit: the problem I stated has recovered for me and I hope everybody else, so I do give it five stars! if your reading all of this with the edit, i had it at 4 stars."
271,272,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,4,Hope Pattinson,"Roblox is a good game to play with other people and make friends but most games have a slight glitch or is laggy which is normal if you play for a while, the glitches and lags are often caused by the amount of players in game. There is a range of different games to choose from for example horror games with jump scares. I definitely recommened this game. Btw if there is horrible people all you have to do is block and report"
272,273,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,3,The Glass Man,"The game has fallen from its previous position ever since it started appealing to investors. Well, not really. It goes really far back. Barely listens properly to community feedback, makes useless and pointless changes most of the time, breaks games, doesn't patch bugs that are on the platform itself and not the problems of specific ""experiences"". The only thing I can see good here is what the people have done and what I've come to be able to find tolerable and enjoyable."
273,274,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,April Magsipoc,"Best game I've downloaded. I've been playing this since 2018!!! I love it so much but there's one or more problem(s) sometimes the camera on mobile zooms in and out, also, the camera on mobile(again) freezes randomly too! If someine out there fixes this, I'd be so greatfull, thanks for reading this rating."
274,275,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Callie Melton,"I love it, but there is one problem. On a windows, you are stuck in only one way you can view yourself. Sometimes opening things in games can move it and then you're just stuck looking down at yourself and you can't change it unless you leave and rejoin. (This prolly doesn't make sense lol)"
275,276,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,3,Maribel Martinez,"I love it. But sometimes while I play the game, my camera will ocassionly get stuck and I will only be able to zoom in or out but cant move it. Please fix this bug because it happens often to me, I will give you 5 stars if you fix it, other than that great game! Would recommend to people who like multiplayer and entertaining games!"
276,277,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Emma Croxon,Amazing game! Me and my friends love it! Definitely recommend to people who want to play with their friends or whoever! Robux does not matter when you are having fun! Also some games do have robux passes but it does not matter. Only one concern is exploiter and hacker problems right now. People being terminated hacked etc. They need to fix this soon but overall an amazing game!
277,278,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Coleen,"This game is enjoyable, but there's one bug i don't like. On mobile, ur screen sometimes get stuck or bugged so you have to rejoin the game so the bug screen will be gone. This bug is been out for like many months ago. PLEASE FIX IT. i would rate 5/5 if you would. But i barely get the bug these days so I'll rate a 4. And one more thing, uh add shift lock at mobile please. So i can shift lock on any game. That would be amazing."
278,279,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Muhammad Isa,Hi I just wanted to say that I love roblox!but there is one bug. A very big one! It is sad but hopefully it gets fixed soon. Also the bug is whenever I type in chat it just deletes my message and it makes it invisible No matter how much times I reopen the game it still does it! I also tried deleting it and downloading it but it didn't fix anything! It is very sad and I hope it gets foxed very soon! Thank you for your time!
279,280,2022-06-19,2022,06,19,5,Sonali Jejurkar,"Roblox is a great game. It has so many games which are engaging and super fun😁. I have one issue tho, I play on my android but sometimes while moving our camera. The camera doesn't move at all. And when I try to move it the screen becomes blank. The developers must look after this issue. Overall, the games is great and I would recommend everyone to play Roblox.😀 Tysm <3"
280,281,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,4,Salvacion Candilosas,"I've been playing this game for almost 6 years now, the only problem tho is that whenever I try to move the screen it zooms in or zooms out instead of moving left and right or up and down. Also when I try to type on the chat box, seconds later the keyboard will disappear leaving the one I'm talking to annoyed cuz I didn't respond on time. I play on mobile please fix this"
281,282,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,annie n,"It's very fun, plenty of games with multiple groups and genre. Enjoyable for many ages. The only bad this is occasionally you will lose connection when your Internet is perfectly fine. But I still love the game. You can tend to get bored of certain games but there are usually others that are lots more interesting. Overall amazing app!"
282,283,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Arianna Behling,I love this app! Roblox is a good app that i can play for a really long time. I like it because it has many selction of games to play. I have one proplem. Sometimes the screen gliches and my avatar will not move. It just sits there and zooms in and out. I hope they can fix this bug.
283,284,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Orange._.Flower Of_._Death,I've had more fun on here with people online than irl. I've been playing since 2014 but I have had a few bad instances where my screen will get stuck and I won't be able to move it. I kept getting logged out of my accounts and could never get back in. Overall my experience was actually great!
284,285,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,Ellie Mugridge,This game is good! It just updates way to often.. Sometimes when I want to play to get a log in on a game I have to go through updating it which sometimes I do not have storage to. This is an edit---- On my laptop I have tried to join many games on different accounts as well. It won't let me play as when I join it says that I have been kicked due to unexpected behavior. I have not done anything and it's weird that it has happened on two of my accounts.
285,286,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Paula Bailey,"Its really fun you get to play with your friends there's no ads so you can play forever but it sometimes disconnects you but it does that only sometimes. Here's a tip if you have cellphone service then use it because if you have on wifi it will be super duper laggy, you can take my advice if you want because it works for me but it might not work for you. Oh you also get to customise your very own avatar which is really fun. And lastly you get to play obbies,murder mystery,bloxburg, and more!!!!!"
286,287,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,4,Marc Howard,"Overall it's excellent, but many bugs occur such as ""no Internet connection"" or ""another account has logged into your device"" I just find it extremely frustrating and irritating, expecially when I find these statements aren't true! I suppose that on computer it is a lot better. Such as the bugs and glitches like when the joy sick on mobile wont work or when you are trying to change your camera rotation and it just joins in and out! But don't forget it's excellent!"
287,288,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,5,RUZANAH Zarrin,The app is great but I have been facing some minor bugs which is still to this day not fixed. Im not sure if it is just me but whenever I try to play a game it shows failed to join game. It only works whenever I reinstall the app. Another bug I'm facing is the camera glitch. Whenever I try moving the screen it is straight up frozen. In most games there are ways to get rid of it and in most games there aren't. That's why I think it is Roblox's responsibility to fix it. Overall I love the app ty
288,289,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Menhera Kun,"Roblox is, has been, and hopefully will always be an amazing platform for gamers to play on but I'm taking off one star strictly for a mobile issue. Sometimes when I pull down my status bar to view a notification and go back to the game, my screen stays stuck facing a certain direction and I can no longer look around, just zoom in and out. Resetting your character will not fix the issue, only leaving the game and joining back serves helpful which is annoying and I'd love to see this issue fixed!"
289,290,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,5,Allegra Sehannie,"This game is absolutely fantastic! 🤘😝. I've made a lot of experiences in alot of games and have truly loved it through out the years I've played! 💖. There have been alot of glitches where it would automatically forget my account and I would have to restart all of my experienced lovely times, I dont know if I made the sentence make sense there, but you know what I mean. So I would like it if they didnt have all those glitches. It would be much more better. 😊 I want a bat dragon so bad! 🤣"
290,291,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,manaia royal,"This is the game I've played with friends and family, since about the age of 6-7, but recently my account has been lagging and not working, it's took 3+ years to build up my account, I've spent some money on robux, it is now not letting my play games, and lagging, personally I play on mobile, and sometimes my screen doesn't move and stuff, So please fix this!!! If I have to make a new account... I'll be heart broken... so please fix the bugs!!"
291,292,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,3,Keithyren Sequerra,"This is the best game ever! but why did i give it 3 stars? 1.Sometimes it glitches like whenever you turn your camera left or right? it's stuck and when you move the joystick it will just zoom in and out. 2.Sometimes when you're chatting with your friends and then you want to tell them something, it just says ######## which makes me really mad because i didn't even say something bad.But however i still like the game tho but i just really want them to fix this."
292,293,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,5,L Kindle,"This game is really fun but it's really glitchy. And I would suggest not having it on your phone, as it may not turn sideways like you want it to, and the game will just glitch out. But, overall this is a great app and all the games on it are fun. I especially like the obby games! 😊 Edit: they fixed the glitch! Now the game (or should I say games!) runs a lot more smoother."
293,294,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Monoc the hedgehog X Joshua,I love Roblox. I even made me account photo a screenshot of sonic projector rp. But the thing is there are a lot of bugs like when you go in menu in a game and you dramatic joystick setting make your camera move as well as you. And when your screen just zooms in and out when you try to move it. Also can you make Getting robux easier like winning specific games and completeing task like most online games. Besides all that I love your game a recommend it to everyone. Edit: I play on mobile.
294,295,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Virtual Guy,"It's basically an engine platform, for variety of community creations. Some games works well on mobile while some games is only available for PC or work better on pc. Has many genre of games, many things to do. Here's somthing bad about it on mobile, The screen gets stuck and unable to look around, sometimes health bars doesn't work when hit on some games, the new menu basically blocks the view by half of the screen. That's all"
295,296,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,4,sOpHia tHe sOap,It's a very fun game. And there are so many games to choose. You can also make lots of new friends. Lots of people are very friendly but just be aware some can be rude and nasty. As it is a online game. Overall its great! Any shutdowns would just be big fixes and they will offer to upgrade from time to time for better quality. You can report people if you they are being really nasty. I would reccomend.
296,297,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,3,Avery B,"The game is very enjoyable, overall an amazing app. However, the recent changes in the app have been a little irritating to me. The characters both created and purchased are combined in the same tab in the avatar section. It eventually gets confusing to find a certain avatar often."
297,298,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,Prita Lagan Diyan,"I rated this app 5 star last month, but now, it's 3 stars. Why? There is a bug on the joystick and the camera movement. Whenever I'm trying to move my camera position using my fingers, it won't. It is stuck in one position. And for the joystick, the black circle one, whenever I'm moving it... It moves my camera instead. And I have to rejoin my experience/friends to fix it. Please, fix it."
298,299,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Molly,i love this game but there is just i few problems. first of all some time when you try to move you screen it will just zoom in and out. second of all it is sometimes very glichy and even when you reset it doesnt do anything but other than that it is a great game and i totally recommand!
299,300,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Tavleen Kaur,"Hi. I am here to tell something about Roblox. This game is good and is playable in free time, but, for some reasons, I want to give the game 4.5 stars. 1) Sometimes when I open a world, the screen goes black and it shows my home screen even if it is updated. 2) Whenever I play a game, it goes laggy. 3) It needs full internet to not be laggy. 4) When I play a game in which there is a map, I just go out of it and it shows that I am eliminated. Please, developer of this game, fix these issues."
300,301,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,4,Anselma Peroso,"This game is very fun! Sometimes laggy sometimes funny.Theres so many types of games to play,like,RolePlays,Action,Survivals,Adventures,Simulators,And Parkours! And theres a problem from the camera screen. When i walk,sometimes it walk itself,and when i press the menu button, it stops. first, if i move the camera its normal, but if i walk, the camera moves odd, or zoom far, sometimes i move the camera, it zooms, and if this happens to other games and i press the menu button, others stops fine"
301,302,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Shelby Steele,"Roblox is a really fun game, but there are some problems with the game. One reason why is the a many bugs and glitches in some particular games! I wish that could be fixed but it's ok for now. Like in some games cant do some things. Escpeccially ""Royale High"" I cannot fly in that game and do something that other people can and cannot do! But that is all for now but get back to me!"
302,303,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,2,Isabelle Blanchette,"Very fun and enjoyable... Until someone hacks a game, I've had many experiences with people hacking entire servers and playing god awful music and flashing lights where you couldn't even see. Also Roblox tends to kick you out randomly, this is frustrating and very random. Definitely wouldn't let little kids play, because I have seen some games that portrayed nudity and such."
303,304,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Chisom Peterson,"Overall it's a good game, my children love it. The pros: There are many different game if not obey role play games and if not Scary than cutcy but there's always something. The cons: It laggs ALOT if you don't disconnect from every single game than it's getting stuck in sift lock or not being able to turn your screen and if not than it's logging you out or even kicking you out the app. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not perfect."
304,305,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,1,UnnamedMax,Game is awsome!! There are so many games to choose. sometimes I type in a normal question and it tags. There's also been a problem with the screen. Sometimes when I'm playing a game It locks and I can only zoom in and out. But very great game! Keeps me entertained!! And also please Return the hair combos because all The hair I bought became useless
305,306,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Sarah Diglisic,"Hello,roblox is a great app I mean it. But there's some problems So this new update is causing bugs on my account. For example i can't use the tool bar to walk I have to tap its very annoying and it's impossible to do obbies and stuff please help fix this bug. My user is bubbleteablox2. Thank you."
306,307,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Fleima Vasil,"There are lots of fun games which are : restraunt tycoon 2 , murder mystery 2 or 6 and many more fun games we love to play. Also it is annoying because you have to recconet , it sometime won't find the person you are looking for[ which are your friends] and it some times make you glitch or when you moving it just makes you go up. There are bullys that make fun of you for not having rubox ,being a noob and not having good things. When people don't play for a long time it need a update."
307,308,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,3,Adriana Duran,"The game is fun and all, but there's a glitch when after I had huge progress on a nonsavable game, it's just for some reason takes me back to the menu. SO PLS FIX THIS. and there's a glitch when if I look around instead it just zooms in and out instead of looking left or right. I'm taking away a star for the bugs and glitches."
308,309,2022-06-19,2022,06,19,4,Atif Khan,"It's a very interesting and creative game but there are some glitches in it. When I join dragon life, my favourite game, it shows the previous chat and I cannot even type or close it so the game play is ruined. When I'm trying to move my screen, it is just moving in and out and it is so annoying. If you fix it, I will increase my ratings to a 5 star."
309,310,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Brandi Fox Young,This is a really good game with good experiences on here! But sometimes when you reset your camera either only zooms in and out or the movement stick fuses with the camera. It's irritating when you have to reset if you get stuck. It's just a annoying bug and I personally think it should be patched. Thanks for listening!
310,311,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,5,Shubam Jandial,This game is soo good . The animations and graphics are so amazing . I like this game so much. I also had a problem in which the game just doesn't work but I think the others had the same problem. Beside all of this the game is amazing and its true that there are game passes that many can't buy but remember by doing hardwork you can achieve anything.
311,312,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Arif Hakim,"My roblox Exprience is just Amazing! I have 1 issue tho, And the issue is the new oof sound. I dont like it its just a bit the disturbing once i die :/ i would like the old oof sound back please. Its just too much for me :v and the sound is like "" ughh "" its just wierd. But this game dosent contain ads and is completely Free! This one of my fav games. But i just wish that the robux currency we could just play games and earn them. keep up the great work!"
312,313,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,DROID,"The game itself is really fun, but I don't see myself playing it every day. I really don't like if you buy an item with robux and the creator deletes it, you can't wear the item anymore, and you can't get your PAID robux back. Also in the experiences, some of the games are really laggy. Other than that, the game is pretty good but needs some optimizations. 4 stars!"
313,314,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,David Zigic,"Honestly pretty good! There are some support issues on chromebook though. The game confuses it with mobile and console. Other than that, runs pretty good. Also, you might want to have a mouse so you can scroll down if it dosen't let you because of support."
314,315,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Eric Burcea,"It's a very good game good graphics everything good I enjoy this game but.... When I use the menu where I can reset leave and blah blah blah it scrolls the camera and I can't control it like it even ruined a 2 player obby and I can't change the walk, run and swim animation it's just Anthro or rthro. Please make the changes oh! One more thing when I make an Alt account the menu updates! And it dosent scroll! But I even want guests back where they can be banned from games and old animations 2017"
315,316,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Haniya Shafqat,"Yea it's a pretty good game but I've been experiencing this very often, When I join a game let's say...An obby. It makes my screen stuck in place so I can't move it at all. And there's also this where it doesn't even load! Even when I have perfect internet. Which makes me redownload it. Please fix this and ill give 5 stars! Thanks for reading! ^^"
316,317,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,4,Jaymar Antonio,"Hello! This game is the best you can create, join different games and stuff but Ive always waited this glitch to be fixed Is that in mobile if you move your screen while opening the menu in the same time your screen get stuck you can only see at one direction. This is so annoying when it happens and it happens to me alot of time."
317,318,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,5,Sarai εïз,"Robloxs is an amazing game filled with many games inside. You are able to join your friends so easily and play together! There are no ads which is amazing. There is one thing I wanted to point out, when I join a game on my phone the game flips vertically instead of horizontally. The first time this happened to me I thought it was so cool and it didn't happen again for a while but know its every single time I join a game its not only happening to me its happening to my friends too pls fix this!"
318,319,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,3,ばんでら久世,"Greetings and salutations, developer. I am here to talk about the reason for the 3stars I gave. So, before I update it, it was fine and smooth even when my phone storage is full. and then after I update it, it start to lagging a lot, crash frame multiple time, and even a bug, don't get me wrong I already emptied my phone storage and all, and it still the same, it also goes the same with my friend's phone. without losing respect it would be wonderful if the developer fix the problems, thank you !"
319,320,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,JammyJams,"First off no ads whatsoever the game is a bit laggy on mobile but other than that it's a perfect game for me, so overall it's great! I recommend playing it! And I'm getting some avatar editor glitches like my saved outfits won't load properly so if you could fix it, that would be great!"
320,321,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Bryan Burnside,"Roblox is a really great game! But on thing that I don't like about is it is that i think that we should be able to put on more accessories like hair, hats, front, etc,! One other thing that would be cool is maybe a game sorter? It would be easier to find games you wanna play! For example: Fighting and battle, Morphs, Roleplaying, ect, that would be nice! Overall ill be okay if roblox dose not add these features! Its a pretty great game i enjoy playing it on my free time! I give its rating a 5!"
321,322,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,5,Tiffany Schroeder,"I love this game. It is so much fun! I love the tycoons and simulator games! I have such a fun time playing with my friends. There's just one issue. Sometimes the game glitches and when I go to walk it zooms in and out. When I go to reset it doesn't fix the glitch. You need to leave and rejoin. Other than that, it's a great game!"
322,323,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,3,Wizby,The game engine is good. But the support is utter trash. If your account gets hacked the support never helps you get it back. Not to mention the filtering system. The filtering system needs renewing as it is very bad at the moment. They should add so it no longer filters anything for people at the age of 18 or above. Clearly everyone swears no matter the age. We will always find ways to derive swear words off of something else and your system is sensetive. That is good but sometimes annoying.
323,324,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,《「Malthix」》 ?,"A very good game that made my childhood. I always use classic camera movement and joystick. Whenever I use shift lock(some games have it on mobile) I get stuck in shift lock even when I turn it off, and its like that in every game I play so then I have to get off the app for atleast an hour for it to stop. And sometimes my game glitches out and when I try to move my camera around, it only let's me zoom in and out. Please fix these bugs for a higher rating. Thx for your time"
324,325,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Edward G,"There are lots of games and they are all great but there are some problems. 1) Whenever i try to enter a game on my tablet, my screen freezes and even when it doesn't freeze, it never loads. 2) Roblox is very slow on devices like phones or tablets/ipads and Roblox always closes. I hope you fix these problems and if you do, i will give you 5 stars."
325,326,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,3,Mary Ferguson,It's a good game but I've come across this bug while I'm playing the game it randomly opens the menu to reset leave and resume and then when I press the x to get off the menu it makes it so I can't look around and it just zooms in and out so I have to close the game something similar to this is when you walk forward you look up without using another finger to look around
326,327,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,5,Tiffanie Ramer,I love it! The app is great and you're able to create you're own games tho mobile does have some issues like when im walking and moving in a game and i accedently hit the button where u can leave and reset and stuff and when i exit it whenever i move my screen moves with it but overall its great and well yea AMAZING!!!!!!!
327,328,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,Sarah Aliesya Rizal,"I love this game, I've been playing for a year. But fix some problems first then maybe I will rate 5stars. 1: The screen glitch. While I play the game and I wanna move the camera, it just zooms in/out. I play on tablet but I heard it occurs in mobile. 2: Jumping glitch. When I want to jump, sometimes the jump button won't stop. Lastly, don't make Roblox such a battery-user. Thanks alot!"
328,329,2022-06-03,2022,06,03,4,alora endaya,"Wonderful game! Included great graphics for some games! One thing though, either this is or isn't their fault, which is my mistake and im sorry for blaming them, but they keep removing features of some items in the avatar shop. Some of which have been made quite worse, or have been deleted for no good reason at all. Many popular items also have been removed, such as UGC items, which have been deleted without explanation, and I'm quite confused about that. Overall, really good game!"
329,330,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,3,donald eloriaga,"There are lots of glitches and bugs when you play on mobile, everytime I try to turn my camera to right and left it zooms in and zooms out, same thing when you try to walk or run. And also when I try to search some clothings in the catalog shop it shows me some layered items even though I'm not looking for layered items, you should remove layered items on clothings and make a new section for it."
330,331,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Lyric Well,"It's a really fun game! I've been playing for about 6 years now. There's only a slight problem, sometimes i will kick me out of games (games like royale high, or piggy). But other then those problems its still a great game! Edit: Its been slightly laggy recently which has been pretty annoying."
331,332,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Mattbluers2,"Very great Game, i would rate 5 stars for experience, gameplay, and wide selection of experiences, and other than that i can also customise my own character with wide selection of creators and items. The thing is why i rated 4 star is that it had alot of bugs, slow moderators, and bad community. please fix all the bugs, thats all!"
332,333,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,A Google user,"Roblox is a fun and engaging game to play. You can make friends and/or play by yourself on any game! I would rate Roblox a 4, because devices can run out of battery really fast if it's an older version. And sometimes lagging and be an issue. But overall the game is very fun to play and it's definitely an experience."
333,334,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Ronald Weasley,"I love it! There is so much to do and I have had this game on every single device I have ever had! I may seem addicted, but then, isnt anyone who plays this? In my opinion, it could be better. 1) Make an offline setting so people can play whilst traveling. Also, because my internet is trash. 2) You dont have to put in your password for nearlh everything because I forgot mine! 😣"
334,335,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,2,Pively,"its a good game. However, the app closes randomly,the avatar editor almost never loads my character correctly and sometimes it just straight up won't let me play even when my internet connection is strong. it's an amazing game,but because of these bugs it isn't that fun to play at all."
335,336,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,AbdulSalam Ashafa,Thr game is overall good but there is a few bugs. Like when I enter roblox sometimes it won't let me in. Then I would have to reset my phone or delete it and reinstall it. So yeah they really need to fix that. Also the camera sometimes just stays in one position then I would have to leave the game and enter back. BALLS
336,337,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Skye Anderson,"It's a great game it has loads of obbys , tycoons and lots of fun games.Great conection and new updates there are some lag problems and a glitch in some games I dont like that you have a limit of friends either so I had to downgrade it from a 5 star to a 4 star but there are updates nearly every year and that's good especially that games you play can be saved to played and you can replay any games at any time. But if you play to many games some will delete from the saved section."
337,338,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,Nathan Millar,"Its a great game, great variety of in-games but im having trouble with the voice chat feature. It keeps coming up with this red warning sign and removes the ability for me to speak. I dont understand what I can do to help resolve this because I deleted and re-downloaded the app it worked for a while then stopped and I cant be bothered to do it again so I need help on how to fix it. Thanks."
338,339,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,3,Faris R,I love this game but there are two bugs. 1. I can't move my screen. It just zoom in and out 2. The jump glitch. It just jumps forever. I have to start over my progress in an obby. Hope this bug will be fixed. Overall it's a good game.
339,340,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,3,Josh Steven-Fountain,"Good fun, although it does require quite a strong internet connection, I always have lots of fun gameplay, and lots of choices However there is the occasional bug, and some games just freeze, and even after leaving and logging back, it remains frozen. And only 40 % of the time it actually works"
340,341,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,4,Elgie Sahidsahid,"The gameplay is better i guess, I change my mind about the game a bit, its a good game, and its excellent, however the most annoying thing is lag the bugs. You barely pay attention into fixing bugs and most events have become utterly pointless, being just ads. The gucci event is literally the only event in this current era that is actually a real event."
341,342,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,David Atkin,"It's a good game. Totally recommend getting! Your creativity will never end! I just have some tiny problems. My game keeps kicking me off saying 'This device has been launched from another account' When it hasn't. I don't know if it's just me but if it isn't then please fix this. And also, it's kind of unfair how nearly all things in the store cost robux. Especially since it says be what you imagine! And robux costs MONEY! So yeah, 4 starts."
342,343,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,•_ s t r a w b e r y r a i n e _•,"[This is an updated review.] This game is really fun! I use it a lot, and don't get bored. I am currently temporarily banned, (I accidently glitched through a door) but overall super cool. There are lots of games to choose from, though I would recommend to steer clear of temper, because if you put money in the game and your account gets deleted, hacked, or locked, the money you have in the game is irreversible."
343,344,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Christine Bernd.t,"This is a great app! But it has a few glitches that need to be fixed , The first is a jumping glitch it won't let me stop jumping , next is a glitch when I try to leave a game it automatically makes me rejoin and a Can't leave unless I close all my apps down restart my iPad then it happens again and the process repeats itself. But if the glitches / problems were fixed I'd rate this app a 5 Star but until they are fixed this is staying a 4 star I rate this an 7.9/10 Great App recommend! Byeee!!!"
344,345,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,lillou penamora,"Well for my opinion it's a great game but when ever you accidentally click the leave button or like reset button while walking, the screen get hard to control for mobile,Well they can disagree to this comment idk and please can you bring or make where u can put 3 or 2 accessories on face and back or just face,well coms and phones can do that using extension. (*ˊᗜˋ*)ᵗᑋᵃᐢᵏ ᵞᵒᵘ"
345,346,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,Jordyn Ogden,I really like this game I think it's super fun and some games are realistic but some other games are glichy but one thing that I want them to add is for bloxburg every 20 minutes you should give us $500 or $1000 I just think it's too hard to get money. This game is so fun it's my favorite game to play and add more free stuff for your avatar se people don't have money for robuxs.
346,347,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,3,levaun .R,New problem there's a bug for mobile players and it's the worst it happens by you trying to move the screen and using the joystick at the same time. Then when you move the joystick the camera moves with it making most games unplayable on top of that yes rejoining reset it but you keep accidently getting the camera stuck to the joystick because YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR CAMERA AND MOVE at the same time to navigate through some of the games
347,348,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Thunder Eye,Bug. When you continuously move your screen and go into the player list there occurs a glitch. After you get out of the player list your screen can only move in specific ways. Another bug that occurs is that after playing a game for a short while you automatically exit Roblox.
348,349,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Jade Poggioli,"Roblox is a very amazing game. During games I play with lots of friends we all enjoy it although, throught the game play if you press 3 or more fingers on the screen at once, instead of looking around it xooms in and out which is really annoying. Some games are also on the discussing side of things watch out for ""untitled game"" they are the ones. But, on the good side roblox is and perfect game for 8-13/14 year olds, it has lots of good games within it. Add free! Other than that it is perfecto!!"
349,350,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Izzy,"I love the amount of games on here, I love being able to create your own avatar and there are tons of clothes options and skin colors. The app works great too, no bugs. No ads. I feel like there should be a bigger age watch, there are 5 year olds playing on an app with 13 year olds and 17 year olds and occasionally 30+ which is sometimes concerning. I do like the safe chat feature! I feel like it definitely helps keep the younger ones safe. Bullying is another issue but it is a dog eat dog world"
350,351,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,bıņğy,"The game is great but i have some issues with it, sometimes id be playing a game, and then when i try to walk, the joystick glitches and moves my camera all nilly willy, so id have to leave and usally loose all of my progress. I hope this is a bug that you can fix. Otherwise, the game is great!"
351,352,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Alok Chakraborty,"It's a very good game. But sometimes it glitches. Suppose I am playing an Obby and when I step on the red thingy nothing happens. Sometimes if I have robux, but it shows – this sign or 0robux. And in some games it doesn't runs properly bcz of that glitch. Overall it's a very good game but plz plz plz fix the glitching problem. I totally recommend this game to you guys. Thank You."
352,353,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,A Google user,"Really good game lags a bit, but over all its the best game I have come across, only issue is the lag and its hard to play some games on e.g. xbox and mobile. Also a glitch that i found is that if you put 3 fingers on a mobile device, when you try to look around it zooms in,a bit anoying but over its the best game. I strongly suggest downloading this game."
353,354,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,5,Samantha Valerie Aspili,"It's very helpfull for someone like me who's got a very low storage space on my phone but is into playing games, it's like games within a game. What I like the most about the app is that you can encounter great peoples who could be your long distance friends and also, it gives you freedom to be whoever and whatever you wanna be. The only thing I don't like about the app is the fact that it keeps eating my storage spaces everytime it needs to be updated. But over all, the app is cool."
354,355,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Lily Golden,"I really love Roblox, but sometimes I get this glitch where I cannot put two fingers on the screen at the same time so I can't move and look around at the same time and if I reset it does nothing I end up having to leave and rejoin. I also get disconnected for my connection randomly when it's not my fault. Overall I love Roblox and would recommend anyone to play it, because of how many games it has."
355,356,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,5,Matt Ballance,"I love this game so much but since I play on a tablet it always kicks me off and it also takes up alot of space. It's also really glitchy for me, it's super annoying. I also play on XBOXONE and I figured it doesn't let you play all games for example Brookhaven. Apart from those things, amazing!"
356,357,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Astrid Makowski,"This app is great for creating, building, and exploring! The gameplay is great, too. The only thing (That happened today) is, my home page and avatar page would not load, I turned off my iPad countless times, but it didn't work. Other then that, you should get this game!"
357,358,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Anne Gonzales,"It's such an amazing game, but during the bugs, might be a problem, with all the Fun games, and horror, I feel kind of odd, or playful. jailbreak, and arsenal are really fun. But you should really fix the bugs and the lagging. also fix the zooming in and zooming out lag/bug. It's really kind of necessary, playing the type of every old game might be already played in 2018, except the every old Roblox logo, in 2013 in 2005. and Those are already old now.. However toxic players should be banned."
358,359,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,5,Natta Chatta,Roblox is such a good game. It has so many games to choose from and it's very entertaining. It is great to play with friends. Ngl yes it is quite annoying when you dont have robux (currency in the game). Also I wish on mobile the jump button is bigger because of obbys (obstacle games). Its annoying when someone sends a friend request cuz it's covers the jump button and when you need to jump you can't xD.
359,360,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,5,Mina Ashido,"Roblox is an awesome game, its only flaws are, When playing games it suddenly locks the camera where we can only move it to left and right or the opposite, Or sometimes I would be playing something and it just suddenly logs me out even if my Wifi is good. There are some more things that make the game really enjoyable though, Like the games! You have so many options and genre's to choose from. and the people are usually what makes it fun, you can chat, make new friends, develop games and more!!"
360,361,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,4,PERFECT HUMANS,"This game started more better, until it turns worst. Sometimes fixing problem are okay for all of us but it always lag, bug, crashing. And it's about wifi.. Sometimes we can move left,right on our screen and needed to rejoin the game. Even fixing the problem is not okay for me because I can't even see games and friends like that. And the good is still good tho"
361,362,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,ZAAGNI LAR,This game is very nice and has a lot of activities for u to do during ur free time. My only problem is when i try to play other games it doesn't work which is really annoying and when it tells me to update it without an option of which to update or not which i think should be an option. Aaide from all that i love this app and i would definately recommend it for everyone
362,363,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,J Eastling,"I have played Roblox for years, and i havent ran into any major problems, but there is one things that happens sometimes when you join, sometimes, when you join a random game server and you try to move, but all it does is it zooms in and out when you try to move your screen, but it can be fixed by just leaving and rejoining, its not raelly a big deal, but overall, Roblox is one of the best games there is out there!"
363,364,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,C S,"The game is really amazing, played it for years! But, I dislike how they are making it more realistic, plus I sometimes get kicked out of the game or disconnect when I have full bars. Plus I dislike the new oof sound I know you didn't want to pay the money but you could have made it a bit funnier like the oof did."
364,365,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Niamh Davidson,Overall I think this is a decent game and is very fun but there is sometimes glitches and games can crash (mainly adopt me) but aside all that I think it is a very fun game that can be very addictive :) There is some things that can be changed such as having to pay for robux. personally i think you guys should have a starter pack for people that contain like 100 robux at least to help some people out.
365,366,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,1,Kyrie Bautista,"I would give it 5 stars. But because of it being too strict with everything I say. I can't even say the word ""Red"" without it becoming tags, like what is wrong with ""Red""? It is extremely annoying, especially when I want to do my backstory for a roleplay.. I mean, I know it's to keep people from spilling out private information and curses. But it's extremely annoying at times. I hope it can be fixed soon. Overall the game is nice but some games do make my device freeze for quite a while."
366,367,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Divine Okoruwa,The app is amazing but after the update while I'm playing it would just freeze at first I thought I was just gonna reconnect like usual but it wouldn't reconnect it would just freeze and then none of the buttons would work it mostly happened to me in brookhaven but now its happening in other games and it's getting annoying so please fix it because my internet is fine just so you know other then that it's a great app continue the good work :D
367,368,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Delilah Wright,This game is very entertaining and cool! BUT it has its problems. Like the game kicks me out and I have to restart roblox and when I didn't remember my roblox passwords as well as I do now it would kick me out and I would have to log back I hope that bug gets fixed. And also when I'm on mobile I tap on the phone a certain way and the screen zooms in and out I would also like that bug to be fixed too. But overall it is really entertaining you can also meet new friends on this app. I just love it!
368,369,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Elda Ephrem,It a great game. there's thousands of games in one app I'm impressed but there's one small problem there's a glitch that when you try to view your screen it zooms in and the only way to fix it to leave the game and come back. you really need to fix that glitch
369,370,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,itzarshi,"Its amazing you can play with friends,play thousands of games,chat to others and create and personalise your own avatar! However,I think that robux, which is the in game currency, and some items such as hats and gamepasses are a bit overpriced sometimes. I do also experience some lagging quite often despite having a new device which is really frustrating. I recommend brookhaven,bloxburg, flee the facility and also restaurant tycoon 2. hope this helped! :)"
370,371,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,4,DaReal PONY,"The game is fun and have a lot of games to play too, but there are problem. Roblox have many problems i can't mention, It gets boring when you play it for too long and i'm trying to find some games to play until it gets boring or repetitive. But overall It's still a good game to play, it just needs some improvements"
371,372,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,2,TeD_Pangoliath2 On YT,"This is a fantastic game, its just that bug were your camera just stays stuck and its really annoying, it happens almost all the time and its a mobile bug, i think its just that roblox doesn't really care about mobile gamers and the bugs which is really disappointing. Please fix this issue. Thank you"
372,373,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,4,Nina :D Ha ha,"I wish you could rite reviews of the games on Roblox, but I think this is a pretty good game. the only thing bugging is that sometimes I get disconnected for no reason even though I have very strong internet connection, and sometimes the game crashes when its loading a new ""experience"". And one of the other bugs is that the game crashes all the time if I have spotfy on. This only happens on Roblox no other apps. (Edit:) the game doesn't load so I can't play. I change my rating from 4 to 2 :("
373,374,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Eva James,"Great game, but can you change the Oof sound back and. Stop adding tags for words and numbers. But, other then that this game is amazing! for playing with friends and family and. Making new friends online. You can chat with people, make group chats, and even add friends, and change your avatar. Overall I love this game and would totally recommend it!"
374,375,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,Sehi Dema-ala,"I Love this Game it's the best I recommend it so much! But I have a Problem. When Your in Mobile You Sometimes can't move your screen It's really annoying. Also Some Random Disconnects When Your Playing. I've Been Working So Hard on a Build in 3008 and A Random Disconnect Pops Out Saying ""NO INTERNET"" But My Internet Was Ok It was Working Well and I Had a Disconnect? I would Rate it 5 stars if there wasn't a problem."
375,376,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Amira El Mejdoub,"Roblox is a great and time-killing game, however there are some issues, first of all, if you are playing on mobile, when you're trying to move it will only zoom in and out, also for the robux, I get it you need money but I wish you could make the prices cheaper, for example a face would be like 100k robux which is like 1000 dollars/pounds/euros or whatever but overall, it is a great game with many options"
376,377,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,-That Rat-,"Amazing. I've been playing for 6 years and in general just fantastic! My account has never been hacked. There is a lot of online dating but except online dating and bullying when your a bacon hair it's just a great game. However,I do have a slight issue as sometimes when I join a gain my screen just freezes or when Im on a game for a while everything goes grey and it would be highly appreciated I you could fix this."
377,378,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,William Guo,"Its fun, However there are many bugs on mobile that are to easy to do that force me to rejoin. For example: opening menu while holding down a tap makes said ""tap"" exist until the end of the experience making camera linked to controls. Also this constantly freezes."
378,379,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,2,Cammy Piper,"Yea sure this game is great but on mobile this game is absolutely HOT BURNING TRASH. there are so many glitches on mobile that make the game unplayable. 1st off, the camera. Sometimes when you try to move ur camera and it zooms out instead, sometimes you can't even move your camera. 2nd, when I try to join a game like Kaiju paradise on mobile, it makes me play top to bottom EVEN WHEN I rotate my phone. Please fix these bugs and other bugs. Thanks for reading :)"
379,380,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Milfin W,"Absolutely rate it 5 stars, right off the bat. I haven't even started playing yet. I've played this game many times before on different devices (I'm using an Alcatel tablet rn) and I had good reviews on all of them except for one, which was an Amazon KFARWI. It would crash on some games and that was annoying to me, ehehe... Anyways, other that that it's a great game overall and I recommend it to everyone 8 and up :D"
380,381,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,ItsARingRing,"I've been playing for the past few years. I love the game and the amount of creativity you have when making things and also the large variety of games you can play! However, I do thing that the moderation for games and hackers need to be fixed a bit. Other than that there's not much else bad with it!"
381,382,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Phong Phan,"Great app, Basically shaped my entire childhood! Just one problem. When im playing a game (and im on mobile) when i go to chat, and i press the icon, sometimes it shows my curser thing, but the keyboard doesnt show up. Multiple of my friends have had this issue, and i hope it gets fixed soon! When it does ill be sure to chsnge my reveiw to 5 stars!"
382,383,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,abigail anderson,"This game is amazing it's a game with a bunch of mini games. The only annoying thing is when you have to update it edit: ok so its been a year now and i see a lot of ppl in the reviews have the same problem with ur screen only zooming in and out, but when im playing bloxburg i dont know if it is an update but when i tap my screen it makes dots leading to a pin which i dont like, i still love the game and i love the online friends i have made :)"
383,384,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,David Calloway,"8/16/22 update: Installed okay on 2014 Galaxy tablet, and lauches, but then screen goes blank. I guess the tablet is too old for advanced gaming! 4/22: Much better on my newer android phone. On my android tablet, a systems stats line covers the controls at the top, and I can't make it go away. It's impossible to play that way. I tried an uninstall/reinstall, which didn't work."
384,385,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,The Forcentral,"Game is Great and Experience is great, although I have to restart to maximize graphics, its a cool game, one problem. When you earn a lot of badges, make it so you can gain 10 to 30 robux each time, increasing the amount of badges needed 1.5x more, it will be a fair system and encourage people to play games more and do something in order to have their favorite avatar combinations."
385,386,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Carlo Funesto Jr. Funesto,"I liked this game. But now, when I join a game, the top bar is not showing anymore. I cannot play a game properly because the menu and chat buttons are not showing. I have tried to join different games, restarting my device, re-installing the app, etc. But nothing solved the problem. I hope someone fixes this problem."
386,387,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,5,Shilpi Islam,"This is my childhood game i play it all the time. But it has quite a lot of limits. I have seen the new hairstyles, they look great but not when you wear them. I would love if they looked like the picture. Most things cost robux, but other than that bugs for me are getting lesser which is great. And theres many scammers,oders,hackers but other then that it's a great game! Keep up the good work!♥️🤧"
387,388,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Sara Martin,It's a really great game but sometimes on some games I join into a server it doesn't load the map correctly and or doesn't show my avatar right either and a lot of people have this problem with not having control of the screen and it's just zooming in and out and with that I'm having that same problem so please maybe fix that cause it's kinda annoying to have that happen
388,389,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,Terra_Gaming,"A great app, works just like the desktop version. I have only one issue, however. When moving to another app for a certain amount of time and going back to this app, if you are in a game, you are ported back to the main screen. I'm unsure if this can be fixed, as this might not be an issue with the application itself and more an issue with the application processor on the device, but it is a tad bit annoying."
389,390,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,zakarridrumz Johnson,"I love the game, it's really fun to play but one thing that annoys me is that the game HAS to be updated one time or another. It kind of ruins my mood when wanting to play because of me having to wait for it to finish. When it finishes I don't have the desire to play anymore. Anothe thing is that the upadating doesn't always work,as if I update it and it doesn't update. It then tells me that I must update again, giving me less time to play, Other than that, Roblox is a great way to kill bordem."
390,391,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Zechariah Shean Bautista,The game is really good but the only thing that annoying is the screen being stuck also the graphics settings doesn't do anything like when u put it to low it doesn't change anything still ĺag but overall its really good just hate the screen being stuck and others. Please fix the screen being stuck.
391,392,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,Nayera Gamer,"This game is awesome! The best thing about it is that it doesn't have ads and that you get to choose many games to play! My only problem is, whenever I play flee the facility (whether it's with a friend or not) sometimes my chat doesn't work/want to open. And it's only for flee the facility. Is there anyone else that has experienced this before and fixed it? If you did, please contact me on Roblox: NayeraTheGamer. Also please let me know if I should contact the creator about this. It's annoying."
392,393,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,2,Keisha,I would've gave this game a 5 star but I hate how the display name can only be changed once in 7 days. I wanted to change it to something good after getting rid of a old name but I couldn't because of this rule. I'm not asking to remove it but once in 3 days would be better. Edit: I now put it to a 2 stars. The game has become laggy in my favorite game called Berry Avenue. I would find the perfect rp then get kicked out or logged out. My phone is brand new and I just started experiencing this.
393,394,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,Mario Miguel Soriano,"It's okay. But i have some problems. Whenever I open the list while walking or moving it's always glitching, which is the camera,it's always broken or it's stuck as the same angle, please fix that, another problem, the friend max is 200, why can't it be 400? It's just bothering me, also, why are the inappropriate games/players not banned? I don't understand.. please fix these problems."
394,395,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,Marc Howell,"So, I still like the game, I've been playing for 2 years, but lately I've been CONSTANTLY disconnecting! And the worst part is, I'm playing this game which has a few quests, but never saves your progress on those quests unless you finish. PLEASE fix this for 5 stars."
395,396,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Tiffey Rover,"It is so good there is plenty of opportunities to customise and make new friends .. the variety of games is good and the variety of accounts you can get is good so if you were to get it get a back up acc and a strong password however I would just like to address 2 things, firstly , it gets super laggy therefore most games are hard to play and light devices, and secondly ot does get boring at times but yes it seems good to me"
396,397,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Lance Bennett,"this is a very fun game and all that but, it is very lagging and sometimes makes the camera vision zoom in and out and it won't let you say some words like one time I tried to say camera it just came to tags and it is giving me trouble trying to change my name it says I already did it in the past seven days when I haven't changed it in like a week or two and it would just go into the settings or just kick me out of the game I'm playing and it's really annoying so I would like it to be fixed☺️"
397,398,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,James Koontz,"This game is very fun, but, there are some things that really need to be fixed; Innapropriate Clothing, Moderation, Hackers, ect. I would really love to play this game more often if you fixed these bugs. I would also like this game far more if there were more features in the avatar section and in-game. This is all in my opinion."
398,399,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,Sophie Campbell,this is a great game for people who want to adventure new things i really support the game but if one bar gose down it reconnects you and its annoying it also takes forever to load on phone even if you have full bars it's just not fair on people that only have a phone and nothing else I feel really annoyed when it doesn't load on phone then I have to go on pc please fix this and try to add an offline mode for people on the go some people travel alot and can play without WiFi
399,400,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,5,Josephine Wilson,"Its vary fun and i like exploreing new worlds and simulaters! But the screen glitches sometimes so its impossible to turn it and its anlittke annoying when im trying to play obbys but there js a way to fix this in some games like brookeaven and adopt me,meepcity to! You have to go in a car and brive around when it happens in brookeaven and in adopt me you have to go in and out of your house a couple of times and with meepicity just teleport places over and over again untill it unglitches."
400,401,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Sarah Johnston,"I give this app three stars because it's well made and there was a lot of effort put into it. I love the games on there and I can be playing for hours. But a few problems: Bullies not getting banned, random disconnecting and lag that can be fixed. Please take this into consideration"
401,402,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,2,Barry Addison,"Am I the only one who isn't too sure on liking the layered clothing? No offense, it looks great! But when ever I'm searching something up in the avatar search, sometimes all I find is layered clothing and I have to scroll down for ages just to find one specific thing. Also sometimes whilst I'm doing that, it just glitches and brings me back onto the avatars home page. Any way you could try and fix that problem? But overall, okay-ish app. Thank you so much! Have a great day!"
402,403,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,1,sunnywastaken,"It's fine but it burns my phone?? Nothing else makes it overheat except for this app and it's really bothering. I can't even play with friends for more than five minutes without having to get off as soon as possible. It's not storage, it's not anything except for the app."
403,404,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Mark Christian T. Despi,Roblox has been my top game since the last 6 years but when i play on my mobile device the game has this weird bug thats is only on tablets and phones sometimes the joystick gets stuck on the forwarded position and when i click it it updates and becomes normal again but when i move the camera also move with the joystick and when i try to look around it would sometimes zoom in so please please fix this. Thanks! 4 stars for now.
404,405,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Kamryn Williams,"Roblox is byfar the best game I've ever played! But it could use some more updating and advantages. I hate that with most games you have to pay for everything with a little budget so I stick to certain games that I don't have to pay robux for. Also I think this app needs better updates for android devices because it is very laggy and certain iPhones too like the iPhone 7. But other than that, I love this game and can't wait for more years of playing!"
405,406,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Hanna Wondra,"It's a REALLY GOOD game, and I've played on multiple accounts over the years. There are tons of different games to play of all genres and you can interact with others and make friends. There's plenty of free items to wear but you have to pay for most items in shop and stuff from other games."
406,407,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,2,CenthranHasSpoken,"Roblox on mobile is just pathetic, I often encounter bugs whenever I complete a mini game I lose anyway and my connection ""timed out"" during my current game even though my connection is stable and runs fine; what angers me most is the fact it happens on my favorite roblox game. Other bugs that happens is that I somehow get disconnected from the game (players freezing in the exact spot). If only I had wifi for my PC but I still don't and I'm stuck playing this awful app."
407,408,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Grand Simp,"Great game for all age groups, Great quality when playing. Roblox contains a wide variety of mini games that are sure to captivate any new players. There is a censorship that works like a charm, so anything inappropriate will be dealt with. There are options to choose a different outfit for avatars. And there is a in-game purchase called Robux that does need real life money, but I would say is relatively cheap with not that much expense."
408,409,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,TehreemMinhaj Minhaj,1•This is a great game but whenever I play one game for more than 10 minutes it randomly crashes or it says that I disconnected.(-1 star) 2•Whenever I play more than 5 minutes it randomly glitches and I cannot even understand the words (which are in English) because the words turn into square glitches and EVERYTHING is fine and the wifi is on full but it still happens.(-1 star) Please fix it that really annoyed me ಠ_ಠ(☞ ಠ_ಠ)☞
409,410,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,bi bi,I really love the game it is great for any ages but there is sometimes a problem like when I'm most gone for like 5 minutes and when I get back why I try to move it makes me look up or down when I'm walking and also sometimes it like stop me and I can't move and when I try looking around it zooms in and out but it is really a good game for all ages except 1-7 I think cannot play cause they are a little young but I think it's a very good game to find new friends and theres a lot of game it's a 5.
410,411,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,2,John Kenneth Caraan,"Tons of bugs in mobile, like the screen not moving, and when I drag the screen it can only zoom in and out, and when I move the joystick my screen moves with it, and also I'm pissed off that i lost almost 20 dollars worth of robux, please add a refund system so that we can get our robux back from unwanted items with just a click of a button."
411,412,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Paris Eleftheriades,It's super fun and not as laggy as it used to be. I have noticed though that at the new update they replaced the oof sound with some sort of grunt when you die. Please change it back to the oof sound it's much better. Thank you and keep up the good work🙃.
412,413,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,2,Merlot,"It's a good app but I'm so beyond sick of the controls locking up, I constantly have to close and reopen the app to reset the controls. It happens constantly....it's been happening for a really long time. Please fix this bug PLEASE"
413,414,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,3,Kylie ott,"this is a fantastic game, but some of the updates are getting worse. the update where you cant add hair combos anymore, i don't understand. i want to make a lot of new avatars that require more than just 1 hair, but with the new update i am not allowed to do this anymore. i honestly don't understand the point of this update, nor do i like it. can you please add hair combos back? if this game is all about ""powering imagination"", why take away things that imagination is meant for?"
414,415,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Zwishing,I love this game I started playing it when I was younger and it has no bugs or anything it may get laggy but that's just because the wifi were using. But after all it never gives me problems and it's also a great way to make new friends for younger ones. I just love the app.
415,416,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,2,Super,"As a roblox developer, the mobile app is disappointing to me. Connecting a controller has a chance to break the camera. If there were half stars I would rate this a 2.5 though. In a players standpoint, this game always goes down a lot and needs better server maintenance, or just better servers that don't go down in general."
416,417,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,3,Josie Ramsden,"The game was amazing for the 1st year of playing it, then started getting disconnected from the game, the game said I lost connection when my connection was perfectly fine, when I tried to change my avatar, I went to classic pants and then it said something like, 'oops, nothing is here' or smth like that, I also got hacked a couple months ago so I added 2 step verification but it still did nothing bcz someone was still logged into my account"
417,418,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Yancy Marie,"Hey Roblox, i very like this game much. Veryyy. But why 4 stars? Its because a bug. A phone/mobile bug. When you're walking then press the menu button or idk my screen freezes! I hate it so much. And sometimes i get shiftlock randomly to fix it i must join a game w/ shiflock then rejoin the game then its fixed. Please fix you're bugs and thank you!!"

Whenever i leave a game/experience my screen goes black and there is a restart button on the down right corner of my moble when I click it it says loading but the your game never launches. It's kinda of annoying for me so can you please fix this bug/glitch."

Its been a month...... still having the same problem."

421,422,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Tammy Butler,Most of the time the game is really fun but there is a really annoying glitch where you can't move your camera view but you can only zoom in and out and there is another glitch where even if you don't have shift lock on when you try to turn your screen it will turn you whole body and it makes it hard to roleplay
422,423,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Paul Mutombo Bonioma,"Roblox is a creative, fun game where you are able to customize your avatar the way you like or be twins with someone. But there is a bug that really bothers me and needs to be fixed! The camera it happens all the time to me, I have experienced it. It's where the camera goes weird and you can only move in certain ways. (I have experienced it in: bloxburg, infinite ikea & mostly wcue! (warrior cats ultimate edition) Though, roblox is the perfect game for everyone that encountered this app."

But when I try to chat it usually takes away the keyboard on the phone for a minute and it's the most worst thing ever, it is just very annoying when I just try to chat to friends. I don't know if anyone is having problems with this to, but PLEASE! Roblox fix this!!!"
424,425,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Midnight Wolf,Its awesome! This game has so many cool diffrent games all in this one app! My only problem is that when I try to buy robux it doesn't bring up the screen to buy it when I click but it works when I'm in game sometimes to buy passes but I can't buy any amount of robux in itself I play on mobile so it may just be issue for mobile but please fix it when you can.
425,426,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,Isla Marshall,This game is very fun! All my stress leaks away as soon as I play. But sometimes my severs are glitching so much! U would like roblox to fix this but besides that this game is highly recommended! There's always a new challenge as soon as i join a game. Some of the games teach lessons which is great for me!
426,427,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Heather Folts,"This Is a great game! You can make games, play games, make friends, and add your friends, imo games with admin are fun! You can create anything with "";btools me/:btools me"", but sometimes it disconnects everyone in the game saying we disconnected due to our internet, which means whatever you created disapears. :( Could ROBLOX add save slots? It would make disconnecting so much easier, because your progress wouldn't reset, or maybe could you try fixing the disconnecting bug."
427,428,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Gabriella Baluyot,"Very good. Although, I would like to ask to fix some bugs like your screen turning black all of a sudden, getting disconnected w perfectly good wifi, and so many more. It's a good app but please fix these complaints I gave. Thank you."
428,429,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Phoenix Martin,"Great game overall! But there are some flaws, moderation sucks, most of the games are hot garbage, while other games are amazing. Some games can really show what can be done, unlike most games, be aware that some games may have inappropriate content, so I recommend games that fit your interest, because Roblox has basically anything!"
429,430,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,3,Renu zimba,Honestly an amazing game I've played for years. But sometimes the game can be gitchy and it sometimes kicks you out randomly. So I hope they fix that soon. I love it but u wish they added more stuff!!!! That helps us pass time. Anyways an amazing app 👍
430,431,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Royale_ Amaya,"I really like this game, i really do, great graphics, good games, etc., however i think it would be better if the clothing, hair, bodys, animations and faces were a little bit cheaper. Overall, its the best game ive ever downloaded and its super entertaining in my freetime."
431,432,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,Taylor Schultz,"This is a great app, but I used to play it all the time, now it hardly lets me load onto the games I love. I don't use it nearly as much any more. In Adopt Me, my character is super glitchy and gets disconnected all the time. Instead of fixing the glitching, it was made it worse. :("
432,433,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Kiwi Boba,"I would give this a 5 star review, but I have some problems. First of all, sometimes (since im on samsung) I swipe up for my notifications. but if i swipe back down, then my screen wont turn and when i swipe it just zooms in. Today, when i was in a game, somehow when i got teleported to a place and i swiped my finger, the screen wouldnt move at all! But overall, great app would deffinetly reccommend."
433,434,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,:,I really like Roblox! I do have a suggestion First I'd like to thank Developers for listening to us and correcting suggested issues that needed addressed I'd like to suggest that maybe we have more servers or something because some games we can't get into. Sometimes it takes a long time to even get in to some games if at all. That's why I'd like to suggest the possibility of either more servers May I also suggest that more Tycoon build games actually save our progress? Thanks in advance
434,435,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Lei Ann Jaycell Pascua,"I really like Roblox because there's so many game. I play this game last year ( 2021 ) but there's a problem when I join a game ( clicker simulator ) I returned to the main screen of Roblox. I don't understand what's happening and can you fix the other bugs because I think if you fix the other bugs I will give you 5 star, I always play the game and favorite the game. Btw that's all my problem 😁"
435,436,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,LISHA SUNNY,No joke absolutely love the game it's has every game you can think of and with your own creativity you can make interesting games but there's one little problem every time I play Roblox on mobile it's kicks me out while it's loading it's takes a few tries some times I need to reinstall! I know it's a glitch but over Al the best app. 👍👍❤️
436,437,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Keeley Dunkley,"An amazing game! You can play games, make games, create an avatar and make friends. It may kick you off or bug but that is why they give you regular updates! Ive made lots of amazing friends, though some are toxic but I dont play with them. Sometimes the updates take really long but i deal with it unless im in a rush."
437,438,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,3,MeiMilk,"I grew up with this game, so I'm going to give it 3 stars. The game is great, there is alot of games to choose from, But there is multiple problems. Sometimes your screen will get locked in a place and you can't move it which is annoying, and the only way to fix it is by rejoining. The moderation is THE WORST I've ever seen. It'll ban you for saying ""Hello"" Or ""Yes"" But you won't even get a warning when you say swear words? Lastly, they don't listen to the players! Toxic community. I'm done."
438,439,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Madison Cox,It's a really good game it just is I love it but when I'm playing the game sometimes when I try and move my camera it will lock it and other times it will just go in and out and it's so annoying when I'm playing a good game and it takes me a while to get on these games and sometimes when I get off a game and go back to the home screen it will just turn grey and white - ish it's a good game do recommend to who ever wants to play do download it if ya want it does not have any viruses Yet
439,440,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Elester Shigaraki,"I love this game, ive created so many memorys with friends playing this, but there are a few things that suck about the game, even though its been a fun fat pile of years ivehad this game ive experianced more than enough glitches and lag than necessary, ALSO the game no longer has the famous ""oof"" sound witch is sad to see it go, as well as the company now limiting backround music and sounds to the games on the platform. Honestly though even though these things suck its still entertaining."

Whenever Im playing, sometimes it zooms out whenever you try to walk or something and even if you reset it doesn't work. And 2. I literally my account got banned for no reason at all. It's really a dumb thing to do but besides that everything is alright"
442,443,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,??,Though the game is wonderful their is this one bug that a lot of people have trouble with. You wont be able to move and when ever you try to move it just zooms in and out and I find it annoying. Other than that I think the game is amazing and you should totally get it.
443,444,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,2,•RandomLittleOof•,"It is a good game i will say, i really enjoy it. But the thing about it that is really irritating, is that when ever i join games like fashion famous or free draw and starving artists, i always walk really slow, sometimes i cant even jump. And after 2 mins, the screen will turn black and wont let me close it. Please fix this."
444,445,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Shaheer Ahmed,Very great app as others say but there is a problem (maybe on this phone only ) that often my camera stuck and can only zoom in or out and it happens after a certain lag then I have to rejoin or go to a place in game that controls camera in order to fix camera . This just ruins my game. Overall good game.
445,446,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,Nylah,"Ok I may seem like a bot but I love this game SO MUCH, I played ever since December 2019 or 2020 January, you can customize ur character, events with free items sometimes, but this game is also unsafe, especially since the ""crosswords"" situation. But overall it's a amazing game and I highly recommend it! :)"
446,447,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Claira,"Amazing game, although it has the bug everyone else has. The zoom in and out. I think this only happens when u leave but then u change ur mind and get off of that screen. But this is the best game ever that I've played. This is 10 out of 10!!"

The only reason why i'm giving it an 4 star rating is because on the mobile version when i go into the catalog it crashes. One other thing is that i feel like Roblox isn't as with the community as it used to, they keep on making changes to suit the ""Meta"" while they won't fix moderation problems and bugs. But i really love this game and i hope it doesn't die yet."
449,450,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Angeline Aho,it's one of the the most fun if fun games you will ever expirience. There are a few minor things that bug me though. number 1: You can't type certain words. Like for example I would be having a connversation with my friend and about half of the words would be ########. They would turn into hasthags. Sometimes you also can't type in certain numbers. I was trying to type in 13 and it was ##. Thats it!

There are glitches, sometimes that have nothing to do with roblox. Some are (for PC) error code 266. This may be displaying ""Connection Timed Out."" Or things some what in that context. These may not be because of your connection was actually broken, but it could just be if an old device issue. Other issues could be error 277 randomly. Do research!!!"

When I came back to the game new updates had released, the game was better than before. I still hadn't the robux I paid for 2 month ago which still annoys me. Now about the game, it is fun even though it has some bugs + exploaters. I recommend giving it a try, have fun!"
452,453,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Carolina Hunt,"Roblox is a very fun game I must say. And there are so many games you can play! Although it can get boring or annoying like when you try to play the game but it randomly cuts you off roblox, or when your screen freezes. I still love this game. 4 stars for me."
453,454,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,3,美味しい餅Kori,"This game is so good. But the thing is, there's bypassed shirts everywhere and people bypassing in the chat, it ruins the game and anybody's childhood. It's not good and I know that you're trying your best to delete it. And you still haven't fixed the bug in mobile that makes your screen stuck in only one direction. I get mad when it happens to me and I have to rejoin to fix it. Also, whenever I try to search a classic shirt in the catalog, it sends me to the detailed shirts. Please fix this."
454,455,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,sonicthegodhog,"They literally say that they give updates to fix bugs, but thats to redo the bug. I didn't have any bugs earlier during the morning, but after I updated it, it was night time when I came back on and then I noticed that I had a sound bug like usual."

456,457,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Kellen Carter,"I really like Roblox! It's a fun game,but this can have a couple pros and cons. You can play multiple different games on Roblox but it has to be online.You can talk with other people but sometimes you can get kicked, or disconnected. Also there are gliches in the game. Plus, you have to update the game as well. With some of these cons I will have to give it a 4. Again this is a really great game, but can you fix some of these problems?"
457,458,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Glam House Boutique,The game is very cool but there's 2 issues with it sometimes when you're playing a game and then your game freezes and then you leave the game I know some people don't have this problem but mobile people do and the final one that I hate the most so sometimes your screen glitches and then zooms in and goes out it's so annoying but anyways this game is good

It has so many games inside, that it's almost hard to pick! I seriously recommend suggesting this to a friend, because it's the best game to play with and find friends!"
459,460,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,2,Jessica Gonyea-Hansen,"Bad game, if your a mobile player. Whenever I'm playing obbies,or any game, I am moving and jump to the next block and all I do is jump. The most infuriating part is all the toxic players. Then, 50% of the time I accidentally press the player menu, go back,and I can't move my screen. The other thing is, the new oof sound. The new one sounds like a 5 year old coughing. Roblox is a multi BILLION dollar company and won't buy the 10,000 dollar one back. Horrible game."

I have noticed I am not the only one with this issue. FIX IT!! I paid for the game to work, not dc me 5 times every 1/2 hour. If I could give half a star I would. It's a great game with potential but it's useless if it keeps disconnecting."
461,462,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,3,Madison1 Mottorn,I personally love the games that this app consists of. However I don't like the fact that they keep upgrading the app like monthly! Its taking up so much storage space on my device and I have to delete other apps that I like just to have enough room to upgrade it! If it asks you to upgrade it and you don't then it will let you in but you will be unable to play any games. So if you have a lot of apps that you can't delete then I would not recommend this app for you. This is a storage waster!!!!!

And the robux is 40 rbx it's not 80 robux?pls fix that and 2nd one is, when i joined a game the screen is black i couldn't see anything on my screen! so better fix that. butt i love the game also but pls fix the bugs on this game it's a amazing game!"
463,464,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Maria Perez,I love this game it's the best in the entire world of gaming but there's a couple problems some being lag and some players hacking and or exploiters more than often (for example a breaking point mode where always theres a hacker who just kills people instantly before the round starts)but other than that it's a very good game.
464,465,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Sophia Friedman,"This is such a good game! It keeps me so entertained with new games coming out by the second! A few things that I'm a bit annoyed with is that when I'm playing a game it says ""Your account is in the same game."" when it's not. No one else goes on my account. Sometimes it's also laggy but that's understandable and with all these updates it'll probably be fixed. Overall, an amazingly entertaining game! 👍👍👍"
465,466,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Keisha Vela,"I have been playing this since 2019 (I had a old account) In some years I didn't have any problems.. But whenever I play a obby My camera gets stuck at a certain angle That I cannot move. And in other games whenever I join another game and I play with Shiftlock, And when I remove it I am still in Shiftlock mode it is very frisrating since I will be making a Video for my tiktok.. please fix this I might give 5 full stars if this gets Fixed."
466,467,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Jonathan Valerie Lara,"It's amazing the ability to say numbers for profiles under 13 and there's millions of games to play and the ability to make roblox games for pc and social links it's great I enjoy it 5/5 😀. But On Android, it kicks me out fast. And I'm on one of the latest tablets. On an unrelated note on PC, I'm moving normal but then the character moves on its own in a glitchy way. Please fix this!"
467,468,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,A Google user,"A very nice game! Its free and very entertaining with millions of games to play. Though the currency in the app costs actual money, which is okay but, it would make more sense to earn it in games and be-able to buy it on the app, or at least put better free items in the avatar shop. Still, such a great game!"
468,469,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,C C,This is the funnest game ever! Ever since I started playing it instantly became my favorite. If you don't know what it is it's basically a bunch of fun games in one. I'd say there is more than 100 different games to play. One of my favorites is Brookhaven. There are some glitches though. Sometimes you can't move ur camera or you can't move at all. But despite that this game if free and fun for everyone!
469,470,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Jojo Osman,"The most amazing app ever, though there is this 1 THING TAT HAPPEN TO MOBILE USERS. Sometimes the screen freezes and insted of looking around it zooms in and out. Hey, also, most things are with robux whitch makes me look horrible. And there are a lot of oders, hackers, scammers, etc. Please fix!!!"
470,471,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Khloe Mick,"I love this game! But I do have small problems, ones that dont really ruin the game, one is how you need wifi, I get it games with online servers need wifi to keep running but it's hard to lag, the second one is how the updates are kinda annoying, it's good that they are beginning to get better but the new outfits are much! the last problem is the chat, I love how its friendly for everyone, but it tags when its ok to say, if you misspell then its hard to chat! Thats all, keep up the good work!!!"
471,472,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,2,Uri Macapagal,"To be honest, this is a pretty good game. Problem is that moderation sucks. Every time I say a normal word, it gets hashtagged. Also, my account PIN was randomly turned on without my consent. Your team says they are unable to remove the PIN. Now, I cannot change any setting ever again, and you removed the OOF sound. Thanks Roblox, you've completely messed up."
472,473,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,3,_saikii •,"I do enjoy the game, especially when I play it with friends, I really do. But I can't play with anyone nor any game at all, reason being is because for some reason there is always a problem with the servers as soon as I open the application; ""There was a problem reaching our servers, please wait."" Or something along those lines is what I keep getting, and no matter how many times I retry it still won't let me play the game. This happened even after updating the app. Please fix this!!"
473,474,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,ツE,"its a good game for any age really and thats proven in the gameplay and people who do play, i feel as though the creators and editors of this whole platform could make it just a bit better for all players if they added a feature on selling old items to gain the robux you spent back. Like in the avatar, if you dont want something you bought anymore there should be the option to ""sell it"" or ""return it"" and gain back some of the robux that was originally spent."
474,475,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,XxLilCookieMonsterUwU,Best game ever.! So i started playing this back in 2016 and alot of updates have happend. I love how there is a variety of free and robux things to choose from. Not only is this a kid friendly game there is a problem slipping in to this game. Online daters are becoming a problem and there are to many scammers going around.That is why I am giving it a four (4). Overall this game is my life. You guys have done such a good job on this and keep up the work! 👍
475,476,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,Greg Bowen,"I LOVE IT JUST LOVE IT ❤ I RECOMEND THAT YOU GET THIS GAME! Just there are some down sides, A it's glichy sometimes.B when is glitches you can only zoom in and out you can't look around. And C when I go in roblox it just sits on the loading screen I have to go in and back out. But I've got used to it."
476,477,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,Hirohito,"Best app ever.Sadly,I have to say,you need to fix problem we had right now.Firstly,the screen glitch.When we playing, sometime our screen would be freezing while touching the control and cause auto walk(I guess). Second is Fps(I don't talk about First person screen).I guess the filter about making less lag didn't working.The longer we playing,the lower Fps we get.And the last one, camera resize and change camera position.Sometime,the camera only allow us to zomming out and in.Pls fix this prblm."
477,478,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,prettylevelzzz prt.2,"Roblox is amazing you can play with ur friends,chat,discover millions of games in one. But I don't like the disconnection when I have good wifi. And the 20 minute thing is really annoying and I lag when I have great signal and sometimes I even use a hotspot when that happenes. And it still does it. But please fix the disconnects for no reason at all. Rating: 4 /5 🌞"
478,479,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Neringa Martinkeniene,"I love this game! You make a lot of freinds. But there's one problem. On moblie, when u play a game (for example, tower of hell) and when I press the roblox icon, u move and sometimes u can't zoom in!🙄 and another problem. I keep getting logged out! It's because maybe I'm too addicted?? Please fix them please."
479,480,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,susan reschman,"Loving it! I have played this game for years! BEST GAME EVER. There is a flaw in it though... like when you try to go in the game and this little box shows up that tells you need an upgrade. I mean what if you don't have service and you can't get an upgrade? But still, BEST GAME EVER!!!"
480,481,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Maggie Watts,its very fun!! just it can be very laggy and gitchy and stuff and like you gotta updeat every month for like bugs and stuff and it can get annoying at times. And VERY annoying when you are playing and it lags a stuff. But yet is very fun of a game! because you get to choose your game you wanna play games!
481,482,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,rick wells,This game is so much fun. Some of the games freak me out. But it's pictures and game the game I mostly play it's Tower of jump is helpful for you to learn how to do oddys. An easy Obby will help you to . Well jump don't have any checkpoints till you will have to learn to try to not fall but most of all this game is really fun so you should buy it and it's free. Every month you have to update it it's not really fun the update it takes a couple minutes but then you can play the game for a month.
482,483,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,MrBean Quandale,It's a great game many other people would say opposite but I have been playing this game since it came out in 2006 so Ik how it works but the only thing that I hated about it is that some of the games are broken like the main games I play I would get in a car drive it the spawned in a new car and it would glitch me through the map but overall it's a good game I personally like it better on mobile
483,484,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,Alexander Gall,"This is a great game and I've been using it as a kid, but the only ""problem"" I have is that when you half-exit out of the app on mobile, but decide to not exit and keep on playing, the joystick breaks and you have to restart the app. Other than that, great game."
484,485,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,ducky quack,"This game has made me into a totally different person, allowing me to get more social without spiking social anxiety, and has a lot of great games to offer. Other than that, I have a few complaints: The oof sound removal was a stupid move, and you made so many people fume in anger. And the mouse icon from 2019 needs to be brought back."
485,486,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,3,AliF Akmal,"I've been playing roblox for 3 years it was a great game but i have to complain about the bugs like 1.screen bugged 2. Setup purchase to make purchases, but if im on other games to purchase it still allows me to purchase something... And why only roblox app can't be purchases... I hope you fix this all of these bugs... Thank you."
486,487,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,what were the lyrics again ?,"i have been playing this game for almost 7 years and i loved it the whole time ive played it but the reason im giving it 4 stars is because how it disconnects you, it mostly disconnects me when i have perfect internet and also when i try to join / play the game again it wont let me so i either have to restart my phone or just dont play the game. i would like if roblox could change this or just fix it but other than that this game is great and i would definitely recommend it. <33"
487,488,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,3,mishalu joseph,"Roblox is a amazing game to connect with friends and meet people, and I love this game. However, I have a few issues. Number one. Tags. I understand that you need them to keep people safe, but you have taken advantage of that. I will tell you an example ""kk"" I couldn't even say it. It would just say ""##"" instead. Number 2 . Chat blanking out. Me and my friends and many other people experienced this, and to be honest, it is very annoying. I really hope you can change this. Then I might rate it 5"
488,489,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,Haidy Makram,It is very nice game . But there are problems . 1 you must have an internet not the all people have router in their home. 2 sometimes the screen zoom in and out . This isn't a disadvantage from the mobile. The problem in the game . 3 all time it send update . 4 in the shop the beautiful things by robux and the ugly things free why???
489,490,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Akeizha Geronimo,"this game is really fun but sometimes i experience lag and bug issues like example joining a game but it says ""launching experience"" ,but still this game is wonderful! ive been playing this for 4 yrs now and somethings changed, i missed the ""oof"" dead sound and the ""its raining tacos"" music :("
490,491,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,2,Tiger Blaze YT,"I love the game, I always play it whenever Im bored. But the reason why I rate the game 2 stars is because random words are tags, and it annoys me alot. And now, Roblox deleted songs that are longer than 6 seconds. And games like funky friday was broken, but now they said its fixed. But while other games like free boombox games doesn't work anymore since the songs are now private. If its fixed and the songs comes back, Im going to give this game a 5 Stars. Edit: RIP Oof Sound :("
491,492,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,5,Jimmy Sallows,"This game is amazing and one of my childhood games. It is very fun and has a amazing service. It has multiple games to choose from and is great for kids 👍. My favorite game is muscle legends and I also love the avatar designing. Though it does glitch sometimes. So I play on a tablet and sometimes it makes me have the amount of slots a phone player would have sometimes when I join a game. I hope this gets fixed. Anyways love this game, the best 👌 👍 😍"
492,493,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,John Jimmison,"This game was amazing apart from when I couldn't get robux but I would definitely recommend getting it the games were amazing too especially flee the facilaty it is a great way to let all your anger out when your beast and hack computers but it is great fun and that is why i would totally recommend getting roblox. Also if you are really into role-playing then brookhaven, bloxburg and berry Avenue are the games for you. The best thing is there are no ads."
493,494,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Sophie Boyes,Absolutely amazing ride through the five years I've played and I'm obsessed however the only things I'd say is to improve the quality of the game on mobile and make a difference to the currency as kids spend way to much money on the game and if it could be earned many more people would play the game! Otherwise best game I've had growing up.
494,495,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Princess Gerardo,So ill rate this a 4 stars because theres a bug that always happened in the game. i wish thia to be fixed ao i can rate it a full stars. this bug is zooming in to ur caracter then zooming out again. i wish thisto be fix so we can olay much better and so i can put full 5 stars in my rating. and another problem is another bug. so this bug is when u trying to move ur caracter its not moving i normaly everyday get that bug so i hate it. please fix this problems. theres lot more bugs that i cant exp.
495,496,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,2,Kaddesja Fillmore,It's a good game but everytime it goes glitch everything is nothing to play only TT3........ S( so please fix it and I'm not sure if I can find help for this but it do work if I delete and download back But please fix it please be and you know what there is some hacks n Brookhaven (hack) the first one is get a horse type AFK ride your horse and your float)And it's going to be crazy if you turn the Brookhaven TV turn it 👉 5 Times and turn 👈 that way you going to see a black girl.
496,497,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Bimo Nugroho,"It's a great game, but it has two major gaming bugs. 1. The camera sometimes being broken and cannot be turned at all 2. The thumbstick can sometimes move the camera, i dont know why but it happends and its really annoying, so roblox, if you see this review, please just please fix this :)"
497,498,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,Lei-Anne Jannah Uy,"I had this game since I was 4, it was great. It is appropriate for ANY ages but becareful cause it has inappropriate emotes, games, users, players etc. What's really annoying about it is my camera stops and gets stuck when i play for a LONG time, it usually zooms in and zooms out while i move the thumbstick and when it tags appropriate words and not appropriate words(it mostly tags a lot of inappropriate words). But other than that, great game...10/10 would play again."

The Camera Glitch - Screen rotation freezes and we need to leave and rejoin the game ......Overall it's very amazing! But, we can't get robux or good clothings for free while some people who can't buy robux cannot get statisfied by very less things,,"
499,500,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,sarah silva,"I love roblox alot. You can make new friends and play whatever u like. The only problem that is annoying me is that I dont have enough storage on my phone and I can never update it. And by the time I update it, like in a few days time it has to be updated again. No matter what I delate, it still doesnt work. Well, it was working thankfully for 3 times now but now it doesnt anymore. So please dont update it that much and it would mean alot to me. Thanks."

501,502,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Veronique Casimir,"I love the game and it's one of my favorite but rn its going downhill. The chat isn't working correctly and the new death sound is atrocious (at least to almost everyone) so I think things need to be fixed, because the game might lose a lot of good ratings and at least 300m people will stop playing the game, which is a big downgrade. Also, when you report someone for bullying, like if they won't leave you alone and keep coming for you, nothing happens . Other then all of that a fantastic game."
502,503,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Aubrey Anthony,"I love this game so much! I've been playing for a long time qns spent hundreds on robux the game does run pretty smooth buy when I'm traveling needed to use phone for my log in streaks it's laggy and hard to play. I do recommend using laptop or PC. Buy other then that I would say roblox is an amazing experience, I hope everyone loves ig as much as I do!!!"
503,504,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,2,Flop,"The game is fine, however the app lacks more than half the features the website does. The avatar customization is much more limited, managing groups, games and clothes is extremely difficult and the app doesn't have some security features the website does. If you're gonna use this app, only use it to play but if you need to do something do it on the Roblox website using the desktop view."
504,505,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Bobby Tilley,3 stars cause I have issues! One: my other phone it's a very laggy phone! And I'm trying to play pet sim X on it.. well- it keeps crashing! Like: it goes back to the Roblox loading screen- I don't understand... And I have have the problem of the screen glitching and it keeps zooming in and out! I'm thinking of quitting- but I'm not cause Roblox is amazing! Other than the issues like: bullies or toxic/online daters it's a good game!!
505,506,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Tevez Julien,This game is a great game over all but it has a few downsides some times in u play a game like let's just say bedwars for. Obile players your screen can get stuck in the position that u loaded or had it in but over all its nice story adventure and events there is lots of games to chose from its great and also very fun because you can go play with friend or family and you can meet new people but there is another glitch when u friend some one at 100 friend and it won't work even if they have 0
506,507,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,pip,"I love this game, I love how people who don't know much about coding or anything of the sorts can create games for people to play! Imagine as a child, creating your very own video game; and suddenly, it blows up! This creates many opportunities for learning and creativity, which I think is great! Royale high is one of my favorite games, as well as adopt me, and most fps games on here. I hope you enjoy the as much I do, keep creating, loves!"
507,508,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,William Clarke,"Very good online game, tons and tons of games inside of roblox. Some of my favourites are Brookhaven RP or ERLC. I'm giving it a 4 because on mobile and ipad if you touch the screen with more than 3 places you can only zoom in and out. Please fix that bug. Apart from that it's probably a 5"
508,509,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Miyuki Tsuyuri,I love this game I've been playing it for years but I'm not very happy with how much robux cost but other than that I would recommend downloading.oh also sometimes when I play some games on it the screen glitches and whenever I walk it looks up and whenever I try to move the screen over it zooms in or zooms out.
509,510,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,MingQi Chen,"In my opinion, I fell like this app is great . It has like mini games , the games are wonderful by the way, you can also play with your friends, which again is really fun. I love the way how my friends and I can play all together. I give this app a 5 stars with no regrets.its really fun and you don't always have to spend robux but it can get really glichy sometimes."
510,511,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Aiden Alcantara,"Definitely recommend this game. Pros: fun games, you get to play with others, and you can make friends. Cons: if your on mobile many games like, Hoop life, or National Disaster, it's longways, many games are only on PC or Computer, lag, bugs. Other than that you should definitely get it"

Most likely the Reports dont work. (For me they never work or have done anything about them) but it is an amazing multiplayer game that u can hang out with your friends on! i highly recommend, this is my favorite game so far!!"
512,513,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,o r,"Hi! Roblox is a great game. The only issue is how your screen locks and zooms in and out. But it does not happen every time I play so it is okay to deal with. Also if you could boost your moderation system, I've seen many inappropriate shirts being made, they get deleted in a few days but it would be better if the game can sense if its bad before the player can upload it. Lastly, I got banned for 7 days once and I think you should look more into it before banning someone. Great Game!👍"
513,514,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,Game Lite,"This game is really good, you can play a lot of games like obbies, simulators, story/plot games, shooters, and fighting games, another good thing is that you can play with a lot of your friends, also you can create private servers to play alone with your friends, plus roblox has a lot of other games. The only minus is that to enter some games, create cool avatars and buy some things that help you out in the game costs Robux and you need to donate real money to buy them."

I don't if it's my internet or the game( i have G5 internet so it's probably the game) and puts #### for no reason. But it is a great game... It has lots of great games and has many abilities... Such as chatting with your friends,can play with your friends, you can play with audio and many more."

But there are some bugs like i look around and my screen is zooming in and out it also happens with the moving joystick it will move my screen with it i have to leave and rejoin to actual play it.Also another thing now my game is extremely laggy and it's not even my internet because it didn't do it before but now it does so it sends me to the home screen and it's not my phone ether
518,519,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,saheli ray,"I'll rate it 4 starts because sometimes when you are on your mobile it starts to get glitch.

And i request to bring the ""oof"" Sound back it was better than the new one."

Sometimes when you are trying to AFK grind while on mobile, you get the screen camera glitch. I mean about when enabling an auto clicker for grinding and getting good at any game. And please fix it. In the past years we've been getting this issue. So please do!"
523,524,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,2,Sonia L,"Roblox was much better before, now it just got worse because I'm having a lot of issues. First, literally always when I'm trying to join a game it takes like 2 minutes for the map to load properly, it wasn't like this before, also the past 1-2 weeks ive been having this issue that i lag a lot in every single game that i join and all i see in the chat is ""___"" with different lengths. I don't know if any of these can be fixed, or maybe it's just me. (Also this review is lazy)"

525,526,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,The Virginian railfan,"I love the platform I especially love studio and enjoy making games But I have a hard time using the material manager and is confusing to me If we could choose between the two for materials like for blocks and terrain because I'm not sure how to change the block material So if we could choose between the two, that would be great and not as many people will be confused"
526,527,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,2,Lonely Potato,"It's a fun game and all, but sometimes when I play, the game randomly exits out on its own and my mouse isn't even close to clicking the exit button. I also didn't press any button that may exit out of it- please tell me that is fixed with the amount of updates happening."
527,528,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Drew Oertelt,"I love this game so much but overall it has some issues. On mobile it locks my movements and it just zooms in and out. I see other plays have the same issue on mobile. Also I go onto roblox and it says internet connection problem, meaning that I have to exit the app and rejoin. That happens almost every time I come back to the app."
528,529,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Rogjeana Young,This is a really good game. It's very fun and interesting it has many different games to choose from. The only problem is that some of the games are really laggy. They freeze my phone and I have to reset my phone in order to use it again. But other than that problem the game is really fun.
529,530,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,Edres Nolasco,"I'd say 4 stars why? It's really a good app but 1 problem when your on mobile and you accidentally click the logo your screen is bug, some game does not provide that bug and I think its for the best if you add shift lock on mobile players 4 starts and its not as great but I'm sure you'll have fun."
530,531,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,L SK,"I have been playing this game for 5 years and I absolutely love it, the problems I have is that they changed the roblox ""Oof"" to ""Gah"" I miss the old one. there is tons of scams, bugs and online daters in this game and ROBLOX is doing nothing about it.. however if you don't pay attention to all of that stuff it's a great game and I will never stop playing it"
531,532,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Hanaiah Pitre,"I've played this game since 2017, and it's a great game! Although, there could be some adjustments. First, why does it tag such random things? It tags ""Hi,"" ""Ok,"" and other much used words. It's unreasonable. Second, why can't we refund the game passes, avatar items, and more yet? I have some things I would like to refund, but I can't do that. Lastly, I could spell one word incorrectly in chat and it removes the entire thing. This aggrivates me SO MUCH. All in all, I love this game!"
532,533,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Kayley Diarte,Okay Roblox is totally amazing! You get to play any type of game you want and even play them with your friends!! You can also chat and text your friends on this and invite them to play with you anytime! Although this does require wifi. I totally recommend you install this and its very fun! I love this and I've been playing it for 2 years now! <3
533,534,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Sophia Yazdanfar,"I like it a lot but the avatar glitches for me and my friends, Also when it glitches in games you teleport through walls or whatever is next to you, but it's really fun overall you can play any game and it's also really good to find friends."
534,535,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,M0mmysMilk.Is.Typing.,"It is a really good game. You cant curse, most games are free to play, and easy to access. I also like the new update a little bit where its 13+ only. Since there is horror, gore, and hella mean kids. No ads, and you can make cool avatars for cheap. I recommend it to everyone above 13! And if you let little kids play, please keep watch of cetain games! I had lots of fun. Cant wait to see what there is more to bring."
535,536,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Ashwini Prashanth,This is a very good app I like how there are a ton of game you can choose from! It has no adds. I would definitely recommend it. Although there is one glitch where you can't really move. You can only zoom in and out and other people have had the same issue. Please fix this glitch.
536,537,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Athena,"Roblox is such an awesome game! It is one of my favorite games to play. There are so many AMAZING games that people have created. The only problem that actully a lot of people have, is that the screen glitches and you can only zoom in and out. So, as a result you can't really see your avatar. This only happens in some games in Roblox. Other than that simple problem, Roblox is a wonderful game. I would not say other wise."
537,538,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,jackie montgomery,"It's the best game EVER download it ASAP! Everything is fun and perfect. And this is a recommendation for the owners of the game can you please bring back the oof or at least replace it with something more... Funny and a bit more to it like a fart or yell or Rick roll song, but one more thing don't make the gane too realistic i don't want humans in my lego game don't remove r16 or r15 or whatever it is just don't remove too many things or make it too realistic please ☹️🙏 thats all folks dat all"
538,539,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,2,Annabelle Brevard,Look I love this game but it constantly crashes I know it's not my wifi or my device because there both only like a year old. I request that you fix the graphics and glitches instead of having constant events. Thank you! -Mushly
539,540,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Felix The Cat,"I love this game I played 1 year in mobile version and There is a bunch of bug that isn't in PC version 1. Camera Glitch 2.Game like: Adopt Me,Animal Simulator,Pet Simulator are litterally freezing my phone for no reason 3. Sometimes it shows ""Same Account laughed on another Device"" but no one is in it because I got a lot of Security 4. Sometimes the joy-stick freeze and you are not able to play until you get off the app then get on the app Suggestions Part: I want to add a new free emote! 😁"
540,541,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Aida Wigginton-Shaw,"I really like this game, and play it very often. The game is very entertaining, and I like that the app has other games on it! The only problem that makes me rate it 1 less star, is that when I play major games like Royal High or Fashion Famous is that it will lag loads, and then will take me to the loading screen. Other than that, it is a very good game to play on if you are bored!"
541,542,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Aissata Sy,Amazing! I love this game! It is a game for people to play and create and interact with their friends online. I would just like them to fix the glitch for mobile players. Sometimes the camera just moves randomly when your trying to move. Sometimes you can't even move it. It can get a bit frustrating.by
542,543,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,1,April M,"ok, first of all, roblox sucks now its boring me and my friend keep on getting kicked off games, and I know people say that PC has no problems, but it absolutely has problems like sometimes whenever it's a third person game, your mouse will get stuck and can't look anywhere else, and you have to completely get out of the game, and then get back in, please fix this, it also takes up too much space, whenever you update it for absolutely nothing it's the same as in 2019, please fix this"
543,544,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,OLI MINECRAFT,"(Can't make this long because of short character limits) If I want to give feedback to a friend about, maybe, a game they created, I would talk about it or text them. Now imagine if you couldnt talk to them in any way. How are they supposed to make the game better? And that's my problem. Make a small section in the experience box where the servers and stuff are and name it ""Comments"", where players can rate and help improve the experience. Thanks!"

My internet connection is perfectly fine, along with my phone too! I've tried turning my phone off and bqck on but it still keeps kicking me out! Please fix as soon as possible!"
545,546,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Daphne Lindsay,It is really fun because the game has many games in side of the app and if you have windows then you can make your own map and it is entertaining to me . But the down side is that if you are in a intense game and if you can't leave you might want to check your wi-fi because it will disconnect you from the game.
546,547,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Susan Bowler,"It is a very fun game but has a lot of bugs for me as if, if I go on to the game more than once it'll make me a lot of trouble trying to get in and it will randomly take me out of games and say that I'm""still on the game"" but other from that it's a pretty good game A few weeks later and this is getting very annoying please fix this"
547,548,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,1,Dian,"There is a certain bug on mobile where unexpectedly, the camera freezes, you can't move it and you need to rejoin the game because the game becomes basically unplayable. For this reason I gave 1 star, if it weren't for this bug the game would a 5 star game."
548,549,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,Grace Hansel,"Roblox is a fun entertaining game personally my favorite games are speedrunner, survive the killer, and brookhaven. those are really fun games I love to play with my friends! The thing is if your playing it everyday it can tend to get boring make sure you have friends to play with! Also I have exspirenced glitching before and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. Roblox will hopefully fix the bugs soon. Thats my rating!"
549,550,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,Natasha H,"Amazing game! Couldn't be better!but sometimes when I join a game,it works fine for a couple of seconds,then takes me out of the game.if you don't mind,could you please fix this glitch? It's really annoying. But besides the glitch,amazing,wonderful game!Keep working on it,creators of roblox!"
550,551,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Adam Navarro,"Roblox is one of my favorite game to play I would highly recommend to play it. I love to make my my own avatar and hangout. But theres some bugs for example, sometimes my camera bugs out reseting doesn't wont help. Then you have to leave the game completely. Overall a great game. 5 stars"
551,552,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,just kylie 43,"I would give roblox a 5 out of 5 because first, it is the best experience second, there is so many games for when you're bored third, you can play. With you're friends although there are some issues like when you're on Brookhaven you're screen freezes and you can't move you're CAmera"
552,553,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,NAI noodles,"Roblox is a very fun calming game, that allows you to wonder and explore the world of Roblox! there is many games, like I'm talking, BILLIONS! there are a few bugs that happen but it's not bad, it's more of just glitching. That's why Roblox makes you upgrade it every once and awhile, but trust me, it just makes it even better. Let me just say, I have been laying since I was 5-6 which was years ago! And I am still playing to this day! I enjoy it so much, it's the one game I would choose to play."
553,554,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,5,Brooke Beaudette,"Roblox is a great game! You can play with your friends, or make friends. There is so many great games. But lately for me, I've been seeing ""launching experience"" and then never works. Hopefully this bug gets fixed!"
554,555,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,3,Arsenio Arocena Jr.,This Is Really A Fun Game Because of the cool games like any type of game is here everywhere you can see games and you can customize your player for free but there is one problem GLITCHES i only found 2 glitches so far and it makes your camera in and out when i turn my camera to left or right and the other one is when you use dynamic thumbstick its when you move the camera follows your joystick thats why i rate this 3 stars.
555,556,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Hello,"The game is great! But when you move your screen sometimes, it locks up and you can only zoom in or out and you have to leave the game your in, and sometimes close up roblox and then go back on. And it can be stressful. And when sometimes you log In into roblox, it says ""Roblox is more fun with friends!"" When you already have friends and then you need to close up the app and go back in and your friends are there, even with fast internet speed"
556,557,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Icey Roblox,"Amazing!!! I play it all the time!!! A game where you can make friends, chat, customize your unique avatar, play game and even make games! You can join groups, and a lot more! Its a perfect game. The only thing which is bad is ""online daters"". That's why most of them get banned for their inappropriate actions. Keep going Roblox, cause you are doing and amazing job!!"
557,558,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,5,mari ʚɞ,"This game has been with me for years, I love it. It's basically my comfort game. I really recommend playing on a Pc/computer/laptop, but mobile is great too! The only thing that made me a little bit worried, is that I get warnings for the most weirdest reasons for example, I got a warning for using an ""inappropriate image"" (I used a picture of water) but overall, It's a way to meet new people online, and play fun games with them! The best game ever, no hesitation, five stars."
558,559,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Lord Sir HamWallet,"ive read the reviews, ive seen many people have the same issue, this issue has not been fixed, on mobile in any game in roblox, randomly your screen when you try to walk itll either move the camera when you are touching the walk joystick, or itll zoom in and out when using the walk joystick, i will change my review to 5 stars when i see that this problem has been fixed, it is a huge problem thats been going on since the beggining of roblox."
559,560,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,GUINEA PIG FUN TV,"I love it!!! But there are some inappropriate things but most of it is great I'm 12 and enjoy it so much!! I Suggest tower of hell,Horse Valley, Bloxburg, and adopt me or obby games in roblox :)! There is one bug I hope they fix is when I'm playing my game on Roblox and, my screen randomly starts to zoom in and out and you have no control but overall it's a great game!"
560,561,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Country Marble Elims,"Best game ive played for sure. Buttttttt.. robux prices is the problem here. Vampire face costed something around.. 75$ but changed to like 52,000$ something like that! But other then that the game is good. This game is well outstanding. Hopefully u change the prices of some items. Oh and those crowns accessories are just hard to get, especially the HIGHEST crown to get. And tbh that crown is one of the worst ones (highest amount of plays playing ur game) 👑 but the game is really fun. BYE C: ."
561,562,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Kady Mckoy,Roblox is an amazing app overall. The concept of being able to both play and create games is very smart and the simplistic graphics make it all the better. One thing I would like is to be able to earn robux by reciving acheivements. But overall a very well made app
562,563,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,gamingwithre,"This may be the best game that I have ever played. I have been playing for 6 years now and think it's amazing. It also got me to 50 sub's on YouTube! One thing would make the game better though. Add daily rewards. Many players can't afford robux, so a system like this would bring more players considering that they can get free rewards each day. And let us say that if the login for like 20 days, they can get 25 robux. It would make the game better in my opinion. Other than that the game is great."
563,564,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,YELLOW Plays,Honestly I like the game but there are a few parts of the game that I don't like. Mostly just the thing where every time I drop my phone it practically glitches the entire game when I try to catch it. Other than that I think the games great
564,565,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Ice Bear,Would've given it 5 stars if mobile wasn't to broken. Sometimes (and for no reason) my camera just doesn't move anymore it just zooms in and out. Another thing is the controls sometimes when I'm playing with the dynamic thumb stick it thinks im moving the camera when I'm not. So when I try to move it puts my camera down.
565,566,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Tegan Cuffe,Great game and an excellent selection of games!the reason why I gave this 4 stars because it's glitches sometimes and it logs me out of my account and it's quiet hard to remember my password! I hope u can fix this glitch. it also disconnects me from games for no reason but I don't mind that! Overall I adore this game!!!
566,567,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Lucy Boyle,"It's now 2022 and my account has been shut for a whole year due to it being hacked then banned, i would rate it 3 stars as the customer service was terrible, whilst speaking to them via email about had happened to my account i was talking to a robot the whole time and the issue could not be resolved. I had spent so much money on robux and had very good items on games."
567,568,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,CD Playz,"I like this game and it is great and detailed but there are a few minkr issues, sometimes when I say a number or letter is turns into a tag. Some people also dont have access to robux to maybe make like a daily quest system so when you complete a quest in a game, you get 30-50 robux. But overall its a great game."
568,569,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Sawyer Schindelka,It's a really fun game and there are a lot of games! The new 3D clothing made it really hard for me to find classic clothing when searching stuff up but I still found them. I really like the game and I love how you can create your own avatar for free and with robux!
569,570,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Niharika,"Hello I've been playing roblox for a while and it's actually pretty good, I'm on PC so I think it's makes sense that it's good but there's a small problem, and that is remove tags from only bad words cause it's making it hard to communicate with other people how am I supposed to go to Google and find a synonym just to try and communicate, that's a waste of time, and can you like add an update like when someone speaks a different language you can translate it to what you like. thanks"
570,571,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Rachael Slusser,"Honestly.i really like it as there is over 1000 games on here in one and I find the concept of making your own avatars entertaining sure it has its bad sides but I really like the idea.Over all great game 10/10 would recommend to anyone with a kid, but there might be bad people who can talk to you so I recommend friending only people you know, and setting you chat settings to only friends can talk to you"
571,572,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Poppy Flynn,"This game eats up my free time. The graphics are amazing and are obviously at the max. I definitely recommend if Ur bored. The only thing about it is you have to pay for robux , I don't think u should have to pay as a starter because then I can edit Ur avatar as how u want it. But that's all roblox needs to change. It's a brilliant game and could play all day. The selection of games are massive and really fun I enjoy all of them . And the amount of people play it are unreal. Get it now ✓"
572,573,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,3,Haikal Daffa,"I quite like this game, but the stuff here is very expensive I also don't know how to get robux. This game has a few drawbacks, which is very fragile if the WI-FI is just a little shaken Immediately the severe lag is really annoying me entering it too sometimes takes quite a long time it's very annoying I hope it can be fixed quickly......"
573,574,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Madison Hansen,"This game is so fun! This game would be way better if these things didnt bother me... For example, I ALWAYS lag, and my game crashes a lot! And yes, this game is huge so its going to lag, but I lag so much. There are some other small bugs, but they are too important. I just wanted to share with u what i think about this game"
574,575,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Susan De Jesus,This is game is amazing and here is a list of things that i like: you can be anythign you can imagine and theres so many games with so many fun things to do my personal favorite games are bedwars and tower heros but the reason i didnt rate the game 5 stars is because when i go to settings (game settings) when i go out of it some times it changes my screen other then that issue the game is one of the best games ever
575,576,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Sothy Tauch,"This game was really fun I grew up with it even my older sister plays it a lot but there's this glitch I don't really like... Well, sometimes you can move the joystick but its also moving the screen. And when I call my best friend, she gets this glitch where you play 3008 and you go afk for a few minutes then you come back and now your screen is stuck. So thats all I wanted to say!"
576,577,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Stacey Cerminaro,I dont like it too many scammers i got scammed 7 times all different ways.Other than that its pretty cool. Very nice games. But very glichy. Other than any of those. Its great! 😀 But the sir is one thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars. The moderation needs to be improved a lot.
577,578,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Mandi Moore,It's a great game! But it lags really bad....ಠ_ಠ.....it'll not let me walk and it'll move the screen by itself to. And on royal high it'll lag even worse . (I do recommend it great game ) it could be what I'm on but if not if you could take a look and fix that would be great. Thank you.:-) that's why I gave three star
578,579,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,brookie_ cookie96,"Sometimes when i join certain games, like natural disaster, it turns my phone screen normal like when i first join the app, or like when im on instagram or tiktok. instead of like when im in a game or when im watching youtube. also sometimes when i join other certain games, which i cant remember the names of, i wont let me move. i can move the joystick, but not my actual avatar. other than these problems, i love this app and would give it a 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
579,580,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Hyro Playz,"The game is great! It has everything Adventures, Actions, Roleplay, Shooter, and more. But after playing for enough time everytime i play something like afs (anime fighting simulator) it just crashes... Its definitely something that MUST be fixed since it ruins the game alot."
580,581,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Zøë Geørge,"Very disappointed , they deleted the most nostalgic part of the game, the oof sound. They replaced it with a 'duh' sound. Very annoyed. Infact, everyone across the platform is in despair over this enormous loss."
581,582,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Cassidy Parker,"Now, don't get me wrong.Playing this game on a chromebook is TERRIBLE, and the lag is worthy of Zeus. However, I find every minute(That I'm not disconnected)amazing in every possible way. If you don't like a certain game? Well, there's millions more to choose from! This is a game I'll play for a long time to come, and I'd like to see another game try to top it. Something tells me Roblox is going to be the first on the list of top games for a very long time, and I'll always have a reason to play."
582,583,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Payton Peddy,"Perfect, amazing, and one of the best games I have ever played. My favortie has to be Brookhaven or maybe Adopt Me. Tycoon's are fun to, but as much as Brookhaven is. Brookhaven is like a real world but in a game. I think it is based off of the real town, Brookhaven, Pensillvaina. (I think thats how you spell it)"
583,584,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,2,Scotty Crawford,I got banned for a day for no reason. My friend logged me out and asked if I wanted to play on their account when I showed them. I said no thanks and went to sign back into my account. My password wasn't working. I checked several times and it was right. I went to change my password but it isn't sending me a verification code. Just lost my account with everything on it. Including birthday money I spent on it and things I really loved.
584,585,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Maria Ramirez,It's a three star because it is a very fun game but there are a lot of issues. If u lose access to ur account then you probably wouldn't get it back. And the chat filter is so bad you can say a lot of bad stuff but can't say some words that are not bad at all. It makes no sense. But it is pretty fun and I have a lot of nostalgia from Roblox.
585,586,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,3,Jason Pennington,I like this game alot but there is a couple of problems with it like the tags and there are some bugs with it to like i can only zoom in and out and can't walk and the only way I could fix it was to leave I would rate it higher but those problems are stopping me from doing that so I hope you fix them soon!
586,587,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Riley Woods,"This Game Is good has some glitches in some of the games but most of the time its fine. Once i wanted to plug in my head phones in to my computer on Wolfs Life 3 and it worked on any other app but when i plugged them in on only that game there was no sound then i got of of roblox and it wouldent play any music,nothing so i just stopped and my parents had to deal with it..."
587,588,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Gabe,"Great game, as the whole world knows. My only complaint is robux. Can you make them not only buyable. But also earned through finishing goals. Like finshing 15 Obbys, or making friends w/ 200 players. My problem is not only the robux. Another would be all the bugs! Sometimes the cameras movement acts up and I can't move it around, only in and out. Also, sometimes my wifi will go down a single bar and BOOM kicked out. In conclusion, the game's alright for fun times w/ friends If on strong WiFi"

Today it's telling me that I'm not allowed to join the experience, I would really like to able to to access my game!💔😭 EDIT: today is a new day and I had to renew my server even though I wasn't able to access it for the entire day before it expired... and NOW it keeps booting me. My internet connection is fine, not sure why it keeps happening?? I just want to play what I pay for!! Sheeshh!!"
589,590,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,christina loughton,"overall, roblox is a great game! i play it nearly everyday, whether im playing on my tablet, xbox, or whatever i choose to play on. i love how theres so many different games to play and so many ways to change your avatar. but lately i've been having an issue, roblox keeps telling me that i need to update, i cant even make it to my home screen and it sends me directly to the playstore, but it tells me that the installation was unsuccessful. is anyone else having this problem??"
590,591,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Muhammad Danish,"On mobile devices it keep kick you out of the game when it frame drop, even a little bit of frame drop it kick out for no reason, please fix, it keeps saying launching experience, but i wait for an hour for nothing in there just a waste of time, please fix this... I just wanted to play my old childhood game... On mobile it's bad, Pc is better but sadly i don't have a good pc"
591,592,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,milton banegas,"Over the years, this game has improved itself to make the experience better for everyone and it has. There's thousands of games to choose from, you can change your avater whenever you want, and new items always come into the game. In ROBLOX, you get to buy robux with real money. Robuxs is money so you can dress up your avater. There are different genres in games in ROBLOX so you can have different experience. This game gets more fun every day you can really enjoy it."
592,593,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Debrah Harbed,Love it but some games and if you want a good looking character you got to pay for it and I really don't like the have to do that I mean yeah you could at least put a little bit more options and then make a little bit they have to pay for but that's way too much so please try to make more options love you all 🥰☺️😊😔😫😂
593,594,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,Yara Playz,"Roblox was fun when I first started playing in 2016. There were alot of fun games that I enjoyed playing. Especially, Adopt Me. It was fun back then and so were all the other games. Especially without all the hacking and scamming. Now, Roblox is very boring. I stopped playing my favorite game, Adopt Me. Because of all the scamming and hacking. And not just Adopt Me. Many other games aswell."
594,595,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Your_Local_Therapist AYYY,"This game is amazing , the games are great and I've played it since I was 6-7. But the Robux are overly expensive and sometimes i wish that you can earn them from playing games or selling clothing. Another problem is I've tried to play roblox on my computer and it lags NON stop. Even if I update it or sign out. Another problem is , I would try to play a game I like on another device and it won't let me and it limits my options. Which overly upsets me. And the tags.Oml."
595,596,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Gia Perez,"This is truly an amazing app, it like Thousands of games in 1...Aside from all the losing friends and fights..I love it! I lag A lot but its not the game's fault so I give it a five star rating because it has earned it, the only thing I don't really like is that you try saying something then it just says ""###########"" sometimes so it makes me a bit embarrassed so something Im trying to ask is if you can make the games hide the tags, and I don't like how a lot of stuff cost over 3,000 BUT 5 STAR"
596,597,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Sariyah McGillick,it's very fun and entertaining you can make friends play some games and much more! You can make outfits Buy items and lots of more stuff you can do. Play obbys building games dress up games fighting games lots more! But there is 1 rule NO ONLINE DATING!!! The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because I joined a game and it looked like everyone was typing spaces but I found out they weren't I couldnt put a name type in the chat ( it would come as a space ) I hoped this helped you byeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
597,598,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,shaista marium mansuri,"This game is awesome. But, their is some problem in it .1. Sometimes i accidently got out and when i come in my character don't move and insted it zoom out .2. When i play parkour game , it got glich .Ex.My character jumping continuously, when i am not touching the screen. Please, Fix the glitches."
598,599,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,3,Annalisa Marie,game is very glitch-ie even with good inernet and made me have a kyle moment but with my device (i bit my phone and cracked the back) also sometimes the thing to see where u turn locks up and you'll have to leave and come back to the game u we're playing. (Also sometimes the joy sticks lock up but you only have to go to the menu) but the games are fun but some people are the worst
599,600,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,DarkYT,"Pretty good game, but the lag and the bugs is the one who is ruining the game, player being toxic, some bug's are the worse like in mobile when you tap too much in the game you get an screen bug that you can't rotate you're screen it only works for up an down, its the worst for mobile player's, there aren't mobile support, Some bug's are still in the game after 2y."
600,601,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,mubasher brohi,"Roblox is the best game I have ever played in my life I wanted to rate it a infinity stars but I can't because there are only 5 stars. I love this game. But somethings are very expensive and some faces and accessories are too expensive to buy not a fair price of skins and faces, characters also accessories as well as clothes."
601,602,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,Samantha Boggs,"Who would say no to a game like this? You can meet wonderful people and learn new things by playing various games, customize your own character and choose between thousands of games! The overall game and all it has to give, is a never ending journey, which is what I call, OUTSTANDING!"
602,603,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,WEGONNA BEPRO,"This is really cool! This is one of the most successful game I ever played!! It's so fun, you can chat with your friends or add some friends to your friends list, I also got robux and the game is really fun! There's billions of games waiting for us to play and u can change your avatar to what you like! Most of them cost robux.. But that's okay! You can customize your avatar with free items! That's all it was really fun playing roblox I played roblox for 3 years."
603,604,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Kiji,"I think roblox is a great multi-player game but it has some downfall, there are a lot of outages and you may get disconnected frequently so it might mess up your game play. Other than that, most of the community is great and I recommend you play the game. There are a lot of games and features to choose from, you can make a lot of friends and create your own games, designs, etc. Roblox is a great multi-player game and you should download it."
604,605,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Natia Kobaidze,"Great game however I wish they were better when mods sometimes. I've ocasionally been banned for things I didn't do or that weren't understood. There is also the fact that some of the things I had bought were removed and I wasn't compensated for them dispite spending robux on it. It's a prety great game. It's fun for all ages you just have to learn how to play! I hope this helps anyone considering to remove the game or buy it. 1 star down because they took the ""oof"" away and its not the same now"
605,606,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Kaydin O'Reilly,"I love it. It don't have any adds and I can play this all day long. However... Sometimes when you go to leave and accidentally click that then you get outta it, it just goes crazy. Like I can't play the game. Because I'm on my phone I need Roblox to fix this. However, it keeps me focused while everyone else is doing something. But please fix this Roblox please. I beg you from heaven into darkness"
606,607,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Dust Moon,"This is an amazing game! Ofcourse it will have some bugs, but they can be fixed in different ways. If you like games that constantly update to give you the best experience, this game is for you! (It only updates once or twice a moth. In my oppinion its not a bad thing.)"
607,608,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,William Finley,Simply amazing that this game I played and thoroughly enjoyed playing on the PC 15 years ago is now capable of being ran on a phone anywhere! Plus the cross platform nature of the game makes it possible to play seamlessly and effortlessly across different devices!
608,609,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Brie Gurtler,"Although Roblox is a great game, there are some things that I would like fixed. One issue is with the layered clothing. It is glitchy on some games and sometimes isn't even on. Another thing is you can't create games and clothing on mobile. Many people don't have the option to create because they are only on mobile. The third thing that I would like changed is how you can only buy Robux. It would be nice if you could earn Robux on games too. Those are the issues and recommendations I have."
609,610,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,3,Vanessa Ann Ignacio,"This app is amazing! I always go in the app every day, i would rate this 5 stars but since there are problems 3 stars. 1st problem. I always have camera glitches and its getting annoying since i cant move my screen! Its really annoying when something really amazing happend but i get the camera glitch. 2nd problem. My clothes are always deleted and i cant get my robux back! I spent so much robux on my clothes just for it to get deleted. I really hate that! I really need my robux back!"
610,611,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Cerelin Martinez,I'll be honest this game is amazing! I have so much entertainment! But there is a couple things. Some people in this game are toxic and mean and even hackers and scammers. On mobile devices your screen like you can't move for a bit. and it softlocks it's self so you can't move your cam and then you can't have control of your cam but this is for mobile. I hope they fix this in the future. But overall this is the most fun game ever!
611,612,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Jai Kapoor,I give it a 4 star as it is a really fun game and I enjoy it a lot but I do not like how you got rid of the music and if you hadent done that I would have rated it a 5 star game. Another reason why I rated it as a 4 star game is that (most people will find THIS CRAZY ) there is TOO MANY UPDATES!!! Whenever I want to play I have to update and it takes AGES. if you made all these small updates into a big one once a month or so and I wouldn't waste time of playing this amazing game.
612,613,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,shyrie santayana,"The game is over all inanely amazing and cool. It is an online platform that allows you to play with friends and other Roblox Players. Why i rated this game 4 stars is because the game has a lot of bugs, glitches, hackers and so much more. I hope the the amazing developers of Roblox is working on it. And as a suggestion, try making a better way to connect with your account, its because I mostly get in trouble trying to log in to my account. Make a better sign up and log in system for the best!"
613,614,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Ivan Atilano,Its a great game and I can play with my friends and it has a bunch of other games to but it lags some times for example the screen get stuck and went you try to move the cámara its zooms in and out. But I really recomend this game.
614,615,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Hannah G,"I like the game and all, but the thing I hate about it is that my screen freezes, then kicks me out the game, your reports don't work either. Only for some games, maybe fix the reports and these glitches."
615,616,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Sean Mishler,I've had a lot of fun with this game over the years. There were a few times where I got random communication errors out of the clear blue. The hashtags do get anoying sometimes but is a very great game and I recomend you play it.
616,617,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,Amelia Jackson,"I love playing the game with friends but however, I have glitches where when I look around it zooms in and out and having to rejoin, I recently got robux and bought classic shirts and two of my favorite shirts got deleted 1) a grunge skeleton hoodie 2) a white crop top. I also think things should be MUCH cheaper like super happy face, I think the limit amount of robux to sell it for should be about 100 or 200 robux leaving people to get much more things and look better."
617,618,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Joseph Naut,"This is a fun app with so many games, BUT the problem is that you have to buy shirts, shoes, pants and etc to customize your character, I give it a four stars because it fun and all, but it's just the robux that makes it sad for people who can't afford it."
618,619,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,Prinz ombar Jubac,"This game is supper fun when you play with ur friends or by yourself, you can also make friends and play a lot of games, the problem here is we can't do hair combos on mobile or iPad it's only working on computer. So my suggestions here is can you please make the Mobile or iPad users to have a chance to make a hair combos cause it's only working on computers thank you!!"
619,620,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Adam Sh,"This game is cool. But, i have one problem with it. When i am in a game and press the sttings button more than once, i cant move my screen 360° . I mean, when i want to lookat the right, my screen will zoom in and i have to leave and re-join to fix it and this is so annoying,so please if there is a way tell me how to fix and if not please fix it so that i can give you 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (android problem)"
620,621,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,Ken Laidlaw,"Personally, I find that the censership should be slightly less targeted, but overall it's a good game. Some games are very fun while others can be used as time passers. Resently, there was a feture removed that I used to use alot; typing the spacebar into the searchbar to see the most popular games at the time. I would like to see this and a few other fetures in the main game, but Over all, the Roblox experince is very dependent on the other players and the recemendations."
621,622,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Morgan Sorlie,It is great! Although it can be really anoyng glichy umm if u play a game that says pic an outfit for free it is a scam and I am in a game and all the sudden it started suming In and out and there is more proploms I just can't think right now but otherwise it is a very calming nice caswal game and I recommend it for anyone!!!!!
622,623,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Trxppii,"Very fun, addicting and engaging. Chat filters are a bit sensitive, but that just makes it even more safer for kids. Plenty of fun games to play and make friends with. It can be a bit laggy on phones, but it's still manageable."
623,624,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Jayce Scott,I finally got my account back after it got hacked but I have some issues. Sometimes my camera will lock and when I try to look around it always zooms in and out. Another issue about the screen lock is sometime my camera will glitch out and when I try to move around my camera follows the direction my finger is going to move my character. These 2 glitches are ruining my gameplay. Please fix this as soon as possible roblox. Other than that this is a great game 😎👍
624,625,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Robert Horn,"Hi! This game is INCREDIBLY fun! I love playing it. There is a LOT of fun games! Each one to entertain you when you have had a bad day. Also, I love how Robux (Their virtual currency used for purchasing gamepasses and items for your avatar) is so cheap! Overall, I love this game. It is a good game, and I hope further updates make the game BETTER (If that's even possible :D )"
625,626,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Clark Tilling,"I have been playing for about 2 years and it's the game I play the most. I see people giving it 3 stars or 2 stars because of online daters, toxic players, and bots however, that's not the apps fault, it's just some people who play the game. It would be 5 stars if there were less bugs and glitches. Overall great game."
626,627,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,1,Bacon,"Can you maybe fix the issue were: Screen freezes, can't turn the screen; Movement freezes, can't move or not move; Chat freezes, screen gets brighter and you can't chat untill you shut down the device. Also, being able to play via website would be nice."
627,628,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Victoria Keelan,"I love this game how you can be with people and play games with them. however one thing about your avatar, sometimes when I put clothes on and go play a game it doesn't save my outfit when I'm playing, I don't know if it's just a glitch but It would be nice seeing my clothes instead of nothing heh. But overall this is one of the best games I've ever had :)"
628,629,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Shannon Tessier,"I give this a three because there are some games that I can't go on, for example I saw a really good poppy playtime game so I joined it, I tried to go in chapter 2 but when it was loading it kicked me off, it does that with other games to, and sometimes when my friends try to join me sometimes it says I'm not on a game and sometimes when I try to join my friends it says they aren't on anything, also servers are leggy sometimes and it's really annoying, please fix these things and I will give a 5"
629,630,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,2,peachyful,my camera view keeps getting stuck or get completely bugged out and I can't pan or move the camera view properly. the only way to fix it is by rejoining which is annoying if the game you're playing doesn't save progress.
630,631,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Frog_Is_Mad,"I love this game. But what I don't like about it is sometimes the screen goes in and out when I try to change the view thing. And also sometimes when I move the s teen goes down and it's really annoying,but otherwise it's a great game and I really do recommend it to people who are reading this :)."

Otherwise this is a really fun game and I love it"
632,633,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Joy Nasan,I love this game! It has so many choices of what to play!!! You can change Avatar and it's great. I rated it 4 because this game can also include hackers and disconnections and lags. I love how you are able to add friends and also there is no ads!!!! DOWNLOAD THIS NOW!!!!
633,634,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Renzo Tomale,"The app is very great personaly and there is a lot of games i could choose from..i love there's a lot of servers i could play with. The problem is it freeze/crash a multiple times, please fix it..."

I will request a way to earn robux, because though the prices are really good, I still feel like there should be a one or two possible ways to earn robux"
635,636,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Armoured,"This game is incredibly popular and is really cool and worth playing the one thing I don't like though is how long it takes a game to load for example flicker, once it took so long to load I had eaten lunch and exercised for an hour and came back and it was still loading.It takes a minimum of 2 minutes and a maximum of 2 hours UNBELIEVABLY...😭"
636,637,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Darin Faisal,Roblox is pretty good but the only issue i have is something not cool my friends are having the same problem i guess. Well the issue is that the screen zoom. In and out and its kinda hard to play one day i was playing a parkour and i was playing it for hours and the the glitch couldn't let me play so i have to leave the game and it made very upset i hope you can fix this. Pls
637,638,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Nidia Garcia,This App is great and all but there is some issues that is happening with me the first issue is that when I try playing my favorite game I can't hear the music and the second one is that there are some disturbing items in the catalog and there are some games thar are disturbing or disgusting an I bet other people don't like them and some kids play this game so I bet they would be disturbed or disgusted to see those but the rest is totally fine and a good game!
638,639,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Cool Human,"It's a great game i started playing when i was young, I've just never let go of it cause it is a great game for socializing and playing with friends and family!! Atleast thats what i prefer. Some people may say well why not with people you don't know, i just don't want to get in a bad issue. (oding,personal info asking, etc,)"

But we've got some problems, when I touch my screen the wrong way in a game it will immediately do something wrong which is, when I walk the screen will move down and I can't scroll around so I have to leave the game.

But the game is good, and it has a good quality, but pls I hope that I would able to rotate while shooting in arsenal....."
641,642,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,Anezka Palande,It is a VERY VERY fun game to play. The graphics are awesome. The controls are good but only one thing...it has 2 glitches. 1. Your screen keeps on going under. 2. Your controls keep on going ahead when you dont even touch it. Overall it is AMAZING
642,643,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Comet Equaria,"Took away my main account because I spent too much money. Technically it was my mom's money... yikes. Guess I deserved that one, lol. Hard to play at times, but otherwise pretty fun. Character movement is a big problem, sometimes it'll just zoom your view in and out instead of moving you. I know other people have had this problem."
643,644,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Gloria,"I love this game but there's a huge glitch with Chromebook users like myself The inventory,menu and text buttons that are normally on the top are completely gone also I can't have anything in my inventory no matter how hard I try I was hoping the newest update would fix it but it didn't hopefully the next one will PLEASE FIX THIS!!"
644,645,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,3,Kay Kerr,"I love it when I was younger but now it does not have a lot of fun games that I would like. it is boring. I would like more interesting games then adopt me or something like that. so you know I do not hate adopt me, just what something different, unique. All the free skins suck. I look bad in my game and my sister too. my sister is getting made fun of in the game just because of her character looks like. I bit you have no full control of that instead of the free stuff."
645,646,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,izzy the softie,Hey so I actually made a review on this like 3 years ago I think? Anyway I do like this app of course there's so many different games and so many different outfits that you can dress up in if you get Robux ... but this one game that's been very popular in the past adopt me is also super fun and is one of the games that I'll recommend as well as murder mystery and breaking point but this is really a great game and I definitely recommend it!
646,647,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Loucelle Centinaje,"Okay, this game is great for real. But the thing is that the shift-lock bug is really annoying. I can't see my face! And the low quality UI. Plus I really miss the ""OOF!"" death sound. That's the sound I used to hear when I was young... Guess I have to deal with it."
647,648,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,3,Imelda,The game was awesome but in the middle of the game it's like it's like it's kicking me out. Then when I want to return it says that my internet connection is poor but it's perfectly fine -the internet connection not the game. I hope you fix this problem. Byeee💞❤️
648,649,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Millan Juan,"The game's really great I only gave it a 4 star since there is plenty of lags. Whenever I join a game, it can kick me out and when I have the most PERFECT internet, it tells me, ""no connection."" I have good internet, and I find it really annoying"
649,650,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Poppie Gough,The reason why I did 4 is because of the lag in obbys. It's the only game I will play because it's not as laggy as the other games. Overall it's my go to game when ever I'm board I just go play it. Lots of amazing games ideas that are really fun. You should try this game and it's free so thats even better. Thank you for reading. Have fun playing.
650,651,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Heatherene Merrill,One of the best games but it has lots of bugs that bother me but around those it's so I just want roblox to fix these bugs first bug is that when I try and turn at the same time as leaving the app or opening the menu it won't let me turn second if I do that but with walking It will move my camera while I'm walking and that's it please roblox fix those bugs
651,652,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,•potato •,"I love this app. So many possibilities and the creativity of this app and the games in it is wild. I have been playing this game for about 5-8 years and never once have I been disappointed. I will mention that on lower quality devices more high quality games on roblox dont work as well as other games, as expected, but other than that roblox is a great game I would recommend to anyone looking for a great game for entertainment and to pass the time. 10/10 rating. My favourite, crossplatform, game."
652,653,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Upasana Jha,"Roblox is literally AMAZING! It has hundreds of world's and experiences. Yes, u can say sometimes it glitches but overall it is an great app! Install it if u feel bored or want to play a lot of types of games. This also is far better than installing many games which fills all the space in your phone, computer etc. Gave it 5 stars that's why 😃"
653,654,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Bebo Welbeck,This game is amazing and it has lots of experiences and games to play! I love it and play it everyday but I have start noticing that there is a glich that everytime I try to load in the game it doesnt work and I have to restart it. Fix this glich and I and many others will give it a 5
654,655,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Delbra Alexander,"I love this game and all but I hope you fix the new/ old glitch I have 2,one is the game that will band you and it makes you say bad stuff not other peoples fault but I hope you fix that,and also the screen,some games like gacha online will let you fix it if you press lock, but other than that it locks you and you can only move out resting will not help so if you can pls fix those two problems ty,and again ty for making this game."
655,656,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,3,LMMAOOO2000.oficial,"I think that the game is very good I love it but in a new update all games have this feature, and I can't see my character's face and the movement is weird. I would like this feature to be optional,because for me personally this feature ruins the game. I hope this is fixed,thank you!"
656,657,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Dexter Treat,"Roblox is an amazing game so much to do, some of the games are even educational. But there is one problem though. sometimes roblox logs me out and I don't know why, I log back in with no problem but it does get annoying after a while. since roblox shut down because of some reason. ( I can't remember why) it hasn't logged me out by it's self. Roblox takes up alot of storage so if you have a device with little storage I wouldn't recommend. Other than all of that I would recommend roblox to play."
657,658,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,2,Shayrel Mae Tizon,"I love this game! But I have problems sometimes. The controller glitches sometimes, it always say my connection is weak and can't log in to other games sometimes too. It has to be fix."
658,659,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Charlie Herrera,"It is a good game its just it may have problems once in a while, And the new death sound is HORRIBLE! cause when i try to move my camera it glitches and freezes all the time and it was a issue for a long time."
659,660,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Hearts & Crown,"Roblox is a really fun game. I do recommend it, tho there are some little problems. Recently I got kicked out of my main account bc I went over sea's. It happened to me before and I was able to log back in. But this time it won't let me. Roblox wouldn't send a email to the email I was using for the verification codes. Im not sure if it's just me or any others but when playing this game just be safe."
660,661,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,peter hoyek,"very fun and amazing game but there's bug like in most of the games whenever i play a game i freeze and crash , its really annoying i have to join the game like 4 times to work ,i tried to fix the problem but its not working and i saw that the problem is happening to many android players. team roblox fix this and u get better reviews."
661,662,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Messy Dylan,Awesome I ❤️ this game but there's some dificultes sometimes my joystick it gets stuck and I go off during Arby's and at my other thumb will take over my joystick so I had to update requests maybe you can make it so only one thumb can control it and sometimes when I'm going forward when I take my finger off the joystick it'll get stuck and it'll make me go off and like all these and sometimes it'll just get stuck
662,663,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Elwina Raboy,This is literally one of the best games I've ever played although it needs a lot of connection and it needs real money. It's alright because there's free stuff you can get on different events I only got a few robux But I still get the free stuff it's so cool...I love this game so much it has so many mini games...I love it
663,664,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Crying Chris,"The one problem is that the camera keeps locking in and I can't move my camera anymore that's when I have to leave and rejoin the game, fix this!! Edit: I don't know but I think someone is hacking into my account since it keeps saying that I disconnected and someone on a different platform is playing even though I'm the only one who own this account and on this device"
664,665,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Viv H,"Very fun game! I play all the time. Although, I don't know if this is my phone or Roblox but it's been having trouble loading. My phone says I have wifi though, so I don't understand the problem. But when I can connect to the servers, I just press retry and I usually am able to play. :)"
665,666,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Jasmine-Ami Wood,"Amazing! There's so many different gamesto play with friends and great clothing. Just with the 3d clothing, some games you can't see it on but otherwise amazing. Love creating games!!!! Just a question for an update, can you please let people playing on ipad/tablet or phone make games? ♡♡"
666,667,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,5,Farah Sinan,"I rate the game five starsmbecause its AMAZING, i dont know what i would do without the game! I have 1 hour to play what i want on the ipad and its roblox! There are a few bugs but the game is big and wild so they don't have to fix them. Over all i would ALWAYS Recommend the game to anyone reading. Everyone should play this game. Because u can dress up ur avatar, u can play some mini games or some games, my favourites are adopt me and tower of hell. But i also play so many more like brige run!!"
667,668,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Thomas Sheene,Roblox is so cool there's so many different games you can play on the app I do however wish that you had the option of being online or offline. Other than that the game is overall a great game I do wish that more of the customization outfits and things like that were free and or cheaper because robux is pretty expensive other than that I love the game. ❤️
668,669,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Madi G,I give it a three because it takes super long to update most times it moves super slow even after I delete everything I don't use and make sure there's no storage to play and it doesn't work so I would like to fix that please thank you:> :] :p. :D. :[
669,670,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,5,Karina Roa,"I'd say in game currency is very affordable, there are no ads, and for the majority, it is an overall great game. They problem starts, when you have to update it. Frequently, I may add."
670,671,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,Christina Kiewiet,i love this game but....i have some dream items and i would have to pay 350$ just to get them and i just wish when you pay 1$ you would get 100 robux. I like the game to but when i want to delete alot of friends it takes a long time threre should be a button that you could press and then just click the ones u wanna delete insted of having to tap one person and tap unfriend each time and the unfriend button should be on the page of there user names. but in other ways its really fun!
671,672,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Kiera Combrinck,Love it!!! This game is amazing there are zero adds and so many games! Although it's annoying that some games will randomly disconnect you so you constantly have to reconnect other than that it's a really fun game!!
672,673,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Tony Scala,"I personally don't love this app but I'm also over 40. My daughter is a soon-to-be teenager and absolutely loves it. From Adopt Me to Royal High to Tower of He!! (and some other game where she's always escaping some insane murdering Granny) she can play it all day and never get bored. My review is based off the intended age bracket, and as such I couldn't recommend it more. A+++!"
673,674,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Gavin Glover,"This has been one of my favorite games since around 2017 it's fun to play with friends but the only problem that there is, is that when you go to customize you can't see all of your clothes so you constantly have to reload the game. But it's overall a fun game and i enjoy it!"
674,675,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Lily Ragget,I like roblox and I've been playing since 2017 but there is a few downsides. 1) Robux is to expensive and i understand that you need money but maybe lower the prices. 2) tags are very annoying at times and I understand it stops people saying bad stuff and giving personal information but maybe lower the amount of tags in gamr. 3) constant disconnecting and lag is super annoying if you add an offline mode it would make it easier to play without having to rejoin games alot. Thanks for reading.
675,676,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,4,Niyati Shah,"Roblox is the best game EVER. I love to play hours of Adopt Me!, Brookhaven, Livetopia, and Fashion Famous. It's such a fun place to meet new people, experience things beyond your wildest imaginations, and to be creative. The only thing I don't like about Roblox is the Robux. It pressures everyone and encourages players to be better than other players and finish games faster. So that's my overall review."
676,677,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,4,Ronan Collins,"Hello,and thanks for reading this review,I've had very fond memories of this game,playing with friends and making new ones,although I'm now getting this camera bug in some games,and I don't think I'm the only one.If my character sits in a chair,the camera will occasionally lock,even when I get out of it. I'm aware that Roblox doesn't read these reviews but on the odd chance that a Roblox Dev is reading,please try to fix it or make it less common,Thank you."
677,678,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Jonathan Nunez,"Anjel is right, when you touch the screen sometimes it zooms out or in and barely move your avatar. One annoying way to fix it is to rejoin or play a different Experience. I probably spend over $200+ not together but it's fun if you pick ur fav type of experinces"
678,679,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Saretta Delhin,Hi roblox. I wanted to say that this game is amazing and a masterpiece! But there's a problem... the updates: like the oof sound or like the free items(I don't want to be rude to ppl can't afford rbx( I'm one of them)isn't this too much??(for me) I appreciate it and thanks for it but... its getting annoying by time :(. If you can do something it will be helpful (if I'm not the only one) but the game is rlly cool I played this game like 4 years and it will always be my favourite childhood game.ty
679,680,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Allisandra Crowley,"Redoing my review because I thought I'd get onto the matter of how I bought premium and it never came through, we canceled and are still getting regularly charged for the 5$. No robux has been given. If you've taken your time and read this, I'm guessing you know my account, and you can give the robux that we're being charged for, and canceling payments. Also we bought this back in 2020. Thanks."
680,681,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Marley Young,It's literally so fun! It has so many games. But the robux is kinda expensive 😕 but either way it's really fun The down side is that when I spam click the jump button it gets stuck and have to reset the game because the button got stuck It's a fun game so 5 stars!
681,682,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Heather French,I love roblox so much! I would definitely recommend to anyone at any age. Its such a fun game even though sometimes there are some difficulties. All of the games made in the game are super fun and creative. I do with that there were more free things in clothing but love it how it is.
682,683,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Buff Me,"It is a good game but you must answer to reports and I can't see the lists of following people, followers and blocked people.and I love the clothes update for example sweaters and outerwear but you have to add updates not just bug fixes and stuff.and I like that sometimes when there is 7 max players in a server there is 8 I think 2 players joined last and at the same time.and it's too laggy."
683,684,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Yuefeng Chen,"This game is really great. I would totally recommend. The reason I only gave it four stars is because of the glitching and randomly kicking players out of the game. Aside that, it's a really good game. I wouldn't recommend it for chrome book users though, since it has A LOT of glitches going on there. But still, they did a good job on this."
684,685,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,JaytheOriginal 30,My experience was amazing but there is one bug I have to deal with every time I press the leave button and click it out my screen locks up and put me in first person and out when I try to turn my sceeen and sometimes I join a game my screen is locked on my character but this game is awesome so keep up the good work.
685,686,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Olivia James,"its a very fun game and i love playing roblox with my friends! On the other hand, the game does glich and makes it where i cant move my veiw and i would only be able to zoom in and out while walking around. I play on my phone (an android) i dont know if it is just because my phone is an android but it is sad that i keep having to leave games while with my friends and loosing all my progress. If you could fix that then it would be nice! <33"
686,687,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,3,Sadia Farhat,"Too many glitches otherwise it is a good game , could make the animation of the characters better , there is a glitch which happens commonly with me it is a zoom in - zoom out problem sometimes u can't zoom in or zoom out and u r not able to navigate properly ."
687,688,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Kids Annand,"I dont play roblox much anymore like i used to, because i found some better apps. I still like to play roblox every once in a while. Roblox is a great game, there's lots of fun games to play, you can make new friends, but there are a few things that could get fixed. For example: glitches, some games are VERY laggy on my device, and after like a minute of playing that game, i get kicked out of the whole app, my screen just turns grey. There's more. Pls fix this."
688,689,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Laura Hos,"Amazing game, it has a lot of different games in one and I would recommend it, But, the fan base can be a little weird and there are some glitches they removed that i am a little sad about like, warping through walls and some others."
689,690,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Gabs The Gamer,"Hello. I really have enjoyed the games Roblox offers. I do have an issue with Taxi Boss being that the very moment I press car shop, it kicks me out of the game. Obviously this feature is essential in this game because you're trying to get the highest rated car possible. Please fix this."
690,691,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Rose and Bloom,"A bit laggy- but it's fun and a overall good game! I can't really blame roblox for my device being laggy! For sure recommend! But 4 stars just because of the upgrades, it would be more fun if it would automatically upgrade like on PC. Thanks!"
691,692,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Mackenzie Hall,"Hello! i've seen you scrolled down to see the reviews. if you are looking for fun and friends, This is the perfect game for you. if you have anger issues, it might not be good for you beacuse.. THERE IS ALOT Of lagging. to fight it, you have to leave the game and rejoin. it sucks cause what if your friends were in the game!!? also there is alot of (Online Daters) its really discusting. but to avoid that block them! i'd say maybe 11+ for this game. but anywho, this is amazing! i love this game!!"
692,693,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,4,Carrie Garner,"My experience on this is overall amazing. However, the chat has got more strict and less easy to use. It censors normal things or things in a different language (such as names of people, food etc.) and that is quite annoying. To conclude, If you are looking to download this app, you should. The chat might just annoy you a bit."
693,694,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Dawn Cradduck,I love the game exceptional choices I could play it all day but several times the app needs upgrading and I free up my space and it still does not let me upgrade it I would recommend and it is for any age but if you don't have much storage space you may come across this problem
694,695,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,Isaiah,"I play this game on multiple other devices, and its amazing, my only issue is when i play on my chromebook, it doesnt let me turn fully, i belive its because the mouse doesnt lock in place to replace it for the game mouse. if there is any way to fix this, please respond."
695,696,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,rylan johannson,"Roblox is a good game but some games or devices will be laggy on the platform and i randomly get flinged half way in the ground and cant move until i glitch out of the ground or rejoin other then that I give it 5-stars because of all the different games you can (Roleplay, shooter, simulator, buliding, survival, etc)."
696,697,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Felicia Watson,"I love roblox so much it's a great game but my exprience has been horrible on my laptop! The pause button,inventory,emotes,leaderboard,ECT. None of these buttons have been showing! My chats or others chats have not been showing either, it works on my other devices such as phone,another laptop but it's not working on mine and it's really frustrating. When I first got my laptop and roblox it has worked. I don't know what's wrong now. Roblox please fix this if it is possible! Please and thank you."
697,698,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Haylee Sowers,It's great when your board but it tags when you say things witch is very annoying but you can have nice stuff without paying and when you do pay for robux you can play you game and spend it but then you spend it all then you back to no nice things so it is wonderful 😂Roblox is doing a lot of updates and it's making me kinda mad having to always updating the game so I would like to have one game last for like two weeks and then change it so if you could change that a little bit it would beawe
698,699,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,QuickSilver,"Great Game!! I really enjoy it, but there's a issues , when i play a game it either lags or just crashes IDK why it does that AND sometimes the camera breaks and only allows me to face one direction and can only zoom in and out. Roblox makes my day alot and when it breaks it makes me mad so can you please fix the issue? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
699,700,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Jasmine Roberson,"I love this game but, people can do bad things like online date, the reason I didn't give it 3 stars is because there are censored words but either way it's kinda creepy cause anyone would know where you live or something Thank you there also is a glitch where if you accidentally get off the tab on your mobile where when you get on it's stuck and you can't move your screen, when you try it will only just zoom in and out so please fix that too"
700,701,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,itsyaboii21 :p,Game is good and all but there are 2 problems. The camera for mobile. It would randomly just lock the camera and zoom in or out when i try to look around and the camera just follows the joystick whenever i move. Please fix this
701,702,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Tammela Hubbard,"These games are funny as hell, just play some horror or roleplay and obby and you well fall in love but I'm giving it a 4 Stars, for reasons just one of the reasons is , blurry problem it's not happening much but it's still ""happening"" every time I zoom in my Avatar it's gets blurry, and etc but yeah overall a good game I play it's everyday :)"
702,703,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,5,gis professional,It's an amazing game & there is a thousands of games. You can play my only problem is sometimes your screen freezes like you can move but can't rotate the screen (and then I have to leave) so yeah but it's all a good game.4.5
703,704,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Rocky The cat22,"I have been playing for YEARS, game needs a lot of fixing of chome book (OS) it keeps crashing ramdomly and won't let me play some games anymore but overalls it fun need fixing like i said before also needs to ban stuff faster like some toxic games but it's very fun if you want to get this game then i would recommend it. Love the new 3D shirts looks very cute nothing much to say but it is a very good game needs a bit more work though."
704,705,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Jacob B,"It's an overall fun game, can't say otherwise. There is so many options in games to play and it never really gets boring. And there are no ads from what I've seen. Although there are some bugs on mobile it is still a great game. Keep it up!"
705,706,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,Ha Tam,"This game has definitely changed a lot from when I started back in like 2014, it needed improvement back then and it needs improvement now. There are still some bugs and for goodness sake bring back the old oof it was so much better. But overall this game deserves it's five stars because it has obviously changed for the better."
706,707,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Melanie Santana,"This game is really enjoyable[Obbys, escape games, mysterys, puzzles, and more]. A bad thing about this for great information I would like to say that this game is public and that there is strangers. Becareful who you talk to. The next thing I would like to say is that If you have a friend who plays this game too. This can be a way to connect with them more. Knowing the things you like that are smilar and can be some nots."
707,708,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,LaLa gaddis,"Okay ive had this cam too and all you have to do is go to your setting click on the circle and press if its follow put on classic if its on classic then put it on follow again. Thats all you got to do then you can play roblox peacefully and i think its really fun because of in my opinion theres bloxburg, muscle ledgens, and other games its really fun and you should try it."
708,709,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,3,Sarah bitz 2,"Alright, the game is great but i have a glitch which happens mostly all the time. When i join a experience, there's a big chance there would be no chat and Roblox icon in the corner, no items and no extra buttons. I'm not sure if it's from storage or if other people experience this, but i really want this glitch to be fixed because I'd say it has been going on for one and a half months now."
709,710,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Depressed Clown,Its an amazing app and experience. But... There are many flaws. First. When you place riblox. Occasionally the screen can sometimes glitch and zoom. And when you join a specific game. Sometimes the game u join auto kicks you because they think theres another account on your account.
710,711,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Amoni Johnson,"So about the new updates, they're good and all but I'm starting to hate royal high. Specifically the the royal high school. I won't even go there because this message always keep popping up and eventually I get logged out. Any other game is decent enough. I think the new updates are what's causing my servers to crash. But it's still my favorite game tho no less."
711,712,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,A Google user,"I think its a pretty fun game overall, though the people in it are rude for no reason, and make fun of people for how they dress and look and identify. Although I'm aware thats not really the games fault but it still affects the gameplay so I have to say 4 stars. Keep up the good work!"
712,713,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Alexandra Kyriakidu,"I really enjoy Roblox (playing it for 2 years now). I find it really entertaining and fun. Though there are few things that annoy me. 1. You need internet connection: it would be nice for people who are travelling a lot, especially going to other countries during holidays, to play without internet. It kind of bugs me. 2. Lags. I don't think I need to explain this one really. 3. Robux. I would appreciate a different way of getting it. Maybe rewards? Apart from that, love Roblox. Recommend it! :)"
713,714,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Cassie Luxas,Okay this game is very good and fun for just playing or trying to get new friends. But just one thing for me it's just that sometimes when you open a game like Brookhaven or just a role-playing game or something else you'll be able to customize your avatar and play just a little bit.than you get logged out of roblox and then you have to reconnect to the whole game again. Or like we're the whole game glitches for everyone. But other than that it's one of the best out there.=)
714,715,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,4,Deb Machado,"Great game, great for spending time but there's one thing that keeps bothering me. Whenever I try to change my username or add a phone number to my account info it bugs and doesn't let me type! I click on the option to edit my username but the keyboard and the thing that shows me what I'm typing (idk the name) don't show up! I've tried it a thousand times and nothing works, it worked fine when I changed my display name but I dont want to keep my cringy display name that I made when I was younger"
715,716,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Ellouise Munns,"I've been playing roblox for years now and it's evolved and improved so much over time , the game is amazing and I highly recommend downloading it . There are so many games to choose from and many things to add to your avatar. Although many items cost robux and robux costs real life money , but apart from that there are lots of free items for those who have no robux. If you put in your age it will only let you play games suitable for that age so it is great for the young. Big five stars from me"
716,717,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Chloe Adwick,"Its great, there's no adverts and its very easy to load up a game of whatever you want as there are millions of games to choose from , I definitely recommend you downloading this game as there is no age limit to it and you can play whenever you want to , the downsides to it are, you have to be connected to Internet or data to play this game and it also uses up alot of battery and you might also have to pay for some games on it which Is why I'm only giving it 4 stars. I hope this helped <3"
717,718,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Marvelle Villaluz,"I like this game and because i played this more than a year !! But I always change my accounts so that's why I'm not a veteran..,well when i play theres some a bit of bugs going..Like when you touch the screen it will zoom and unzoom and when you zoom in your screen for the rest of the game your playing and once you leave and join another game I'll be stuck on lockshifts idk if that's a bug or not.. But i still rate this game 5🌟!!"
718,719,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,4,Sithara Muralidas,"This game is wizard. There are more than 10 games in it that I love. I appreciate the amount of games, camera adjustments and the friend options. The reason why I gave this four stars is because sometimes when I start the app, it doesn't load and I have to restart. Also because my camera doesn't move at all recently, and I can't join my friends even of the experience is not full. I'd love if you'd fix these glitches. Other than these problems, the game is jolly great and fun."
719,720,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,Farah Aden,"I love this game on mobile too much! I have an issue with the lag on pc. Can you have a shot at fixing the lag? If there wasn't too much lag, I would have given it a 5. This game is really cool but then just a few days ago, Roblox moderation has gotten really bad and people are getting banned for some thing that they never did. Overall, its really fun especially arsenal like literally. I got free robux using Microsoft Rewards so now you don't need to pay for robux, you earn it! I recommend this!"
720,721,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,5,Anushka Upadhyay,Literally the best game i ever played... i totally recommend it! Only one problem.... I report some toxic people but it doesn't work??? And sometimes the screen gets crazy like when i click on the screen to change the direction... It keeps on getting zoomed in and out.. pls fix that. I love the game or i shall say games! It has many interesting games! My fav is adopt me! Tysm for making this game!!
721,722,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Agustina Chingotto,It is very hard for me to get off the game it's sooooo fun! I LOVE IT SO MUCH but it's a problem that mostly go to the Brookhaven sometimes when I play when I move I just go backwards and when I go on dress up I can't see my face so please fix that
722,723,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Rhonndie Pacaanas,"Honestly It's a great game, It's just that there's alot of things that surpass the roblox guidelines and no one is taking responsibility of fixing that problem and also reports don't even work, and the camera always gets broken for no reason, and PLEASE when a person friends you, please move the friend request on top of the screen and not on the jump button, cause It's so annoying when the friend request blocks the jump button, alright that's all I hope you guys look into this review."
723,724,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,Samuel Almazan,"Very good game, one thing though. There is a glich we're there is a big transparent black square around the walk button and it is annoying because it stays there the whole time I'm playing. Example: Mining Simulator 2"
724,725,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Lucy and Galaxy gamers,I love your Roblox Game Keep up the good work!. But I've been having a problem with this app lately. So I tried to go on the app A few seconds later the app just blacks out. I wasn't even able to sign up I tried to clear storage of Roblox but that didn't work. I even powdered off my fully and it still didn't work
725,726,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Aisyah's Life,This app is great for people that are aged 9+. But there are bugs that are very annoying. 1. The zooming bug It wont let me move the camera until i rejoin. 2. Kicked out of the game It automatically kicks me out of the game on a specific battery level. 3. Private chat It wont let me out of private chat. 4. The clothing bug It randomly removes the clothes im wearing. [ not not content delete it just removes out of my avatar. ]
726,727,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,5,Yasmin Sultana,"I love this game you should def download it BUT the update part is very annoying. I DONT NEED TO UPDATE OKAY. Also, there are many bugs but if you rejoin/uninstall and reinstall it's fixed. Sometimes after I reinstall, I try to log in but says password incorrect, when I KNOW its correct, so I reset password but it doesn't work for a long time. But, recently it hasn't been happening so yay? Overall: Amazing-ly sus"
727,728,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Not_Ziane_ Xeng,"It's a great game, I've been playing this for about 2-3 years. But the reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the bugs, such as; Stuck Camera, and it sometimes would kick you out of the game because it says someone else is playing in another device. Hope you fix these bugs! Overall it is a fun game, I love it!"
728,729,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Aleyah Bowen,I love the games the experience and the avatar you can decorate And bye bobox But there are some issues in the game first it just goes in an out and I find that really annoying and u really hope you fix this whoever made the game but besides that it is a really great good game and it really helps me understand things that I don't
729,730,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,3,Gab G,"THE CHAT IS ALWAYS GLITCHING ON MOBILE, I often play on mobile and when i do the chat doesn't work if I click on the chat to type it either takes my keyboard a thousand years to pop up or it doesn't pop up at all. It is extremely annoying , it's also not something wrong with my device because it is the same situation for 10- 16 other mobile players i know."
730,731,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,2,《baxicxally milxy》,"A really nice game with alot of games to choose with, lately i've been experiencing that my camera does not move at all, and it glitches badly. For some reason even more and more updates roblox makes , it does not even fix this camera bug. I'll give a cirtisim to fix this issue."
731,732,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Dyno Saurus,"Great game, not so good graphics, (depending on the game you play) but the main reason why I'm giving it 4 stars, I want the oof sound effect back. The new one hurts my ears, so either find a sound effect better that the wierd current sound closer to the oof, or just make a new one in general."
732,733,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Robert Springs,It's such a fun game I love the other games inside of it too but the thing is sometimes when you try to answer certain games on mobile it won't let you cuz it says you don't have the right device. Also when you enter one and it lets you sometimes on mobile it'll like freeze and then Roblox will kick you that's all bye.
733,734,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Jaley Jackson,"I enjoy some of the games. I've played Roblox pretty well since it came out. *Or at least before it was to to big.* I don't have really any big complaints, other then just being cautious about the pictures for the games. *Some people upload games that the pictures are a little more scary and or scandalous, but I completely understand if there is nothing that can be done about that. Anyway, for the most part I like it and would recommend. I would say it is mainly used by 6-18ish. Thank you!👍"
734,735,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,I'mlitterly_ nocoo,"hello, I gave 2 stars because of how I couldn't log back in on the new ""2 verify steps"" update. I was just exploring my accounts Setting and it just happend that I accidentally clicked on the ""2 verify steps"" botton without reading it. I've been asking through the mail multiple times for my 9 pin codes. The service gave me 8numbers wich only failed one more number. Please Roblox all I ever wanted is that being able to play Roblox normally again."
735,736,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,3,Rebekah Llona,So I'll give this a 3 star because I buyed a gift card from an online shop in here in Philippines and it's 1000 + Premium I forgot that I have to cancel it but when I'm about to cancel it I can't. I looked up on Google and it said if it didn't show up it will show up in the app store and Google play. And I checked and the subscription on Roblox is not there and I still can't get to cancel my subscription please I don't know what to do at least fix this bug.
736,737,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Justyce Crump,"It's a great game been playing for many years now. I'm not going to lie obviously there are issues but they are minimal... lag, crashing, and roblox is down every now and then. it's great to make new friends. This one game has way more games inside. It has many different types of game genres. So I'd say it has its pros and cons."
737,738,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,Y Yang,"Roblox is so fun and I would definitely recommend getting it! Although, there are too many oders, hackers & other bugs which needs to be fixed. Also, some items in the catalog are a bit overpriced. But, overall it's VERY fun game and has many original games in the app."
738,739,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,2,Pokemon 617,"its a good game, i enjoying it a lot, but the reason i gave this 2 star i because its so annoying that in the middle of the game it keeps kicking me off and sometimes it kick you off and a loading screen will pop up that say loading experience!! pls fix this."
739,740,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,s kp,"I love this game! It is awsome but just one thing verry anoying, and I think it is only with chromebooks, witch I use. Let's say I'm playing piggy in first person. When I try to pick up a tool or key my curser goes all the way across the screan. It goes were it would be if I was not in first person, also it does not let me spin around alow when in first person. That is all that I don't like so please, if you can, work on that and make it stay in the midle. Thx."
740,741,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Brody Mcdowell,This game/games are so fun because there is so many games to choose from and you can also make games the only issue I have is sometimes in games it glitches out and your camera movements get messed up but other than that the is a very fun game and I must recommend it fore sure.
741,742,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,3,Alexa Nicole,"Game's cool. I like how one app can provide you with many more games to play. the shop is alright, sometimes the music when playing doesn't start, camera problems like it gets stuck and you'll have to leave and join again. But overall i do like this game, just needs bugs to be fixed."
742,743,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Liyaana Muhammad,"I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME! there is just a few things that really annoy me. 1: sometimes it blurs out what your saying in chat, I get it the curse words are fine, but phone? Mobile? Please what is wrong with those- 2: when you have the game for a while, the clothes will get blurry and glitchy. I don't know how to fix it but it's very annoying. 3: if your moving the joy stick while you click top left where the roblox sigh is it will combine with the joy stick same thing with the camera."
743,744,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Rebekah McLeod,This game is so creative and inspirational and I have been playing this game for a long time although it has gotten a little wonky throughout the years for example on mobile its not the best and sometimes when your walking your screen zooms in and you really cannot fix it without leaving the game. Something else I was not pleased with is how they got rid of the roblox id codes for copyright and on multiple games I have paid money to have music boxes and certain game passes what a waste!
744,745,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,5,Stian Uche Orji,Is awesome but with a lot of bugs and it requires a strong internet connection and about the bugs the are to many sometimes you may can't move the camera and that is a big problem but I am giving 5stars because I really like the idea of putting a lot of games in 1 app and you can create it by your self many world's but another problem is that something you can not do them in your phone or tablet only in the PC and that is white sad but is a beautiful game thank you that you trying to fix all
745,746,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,5,Anozumi,"I love it just don't like there's so many expensive items but they look very very simple😅(opinion) but the good side you can chat with friends customizing ur avatar and again the down side is the (###) i hate when this happens.. It's not even a bad thing but 5 star's,there's also some toxic players i think reporting does nothing too,so please fix some of these overall pretty good!"
746,747,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Jewelleah Smith,"I love everything about Roblox it is an amazing experience, I have some issues with getting into games like adopt me the screen will glitch and take me to the bottom of the map and I have to join back. But other than that I love the game. It has amazing qualities."
747,748,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Angel Lopez,"Its awesome but it glitches alot so its pretty hard to play games. but its still fun and the new stuff you add, its nice but when I get something and wear it and see what it looks like the editor takes like 1 hour to load so could you fix this and when I have to update it, doesn't work so please fix that too."
748,749,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,2,Bruhboi 69lol,"Honestly games in roblox I play are totally fun but there's been glitches and bugs which I hope can be fixed. #1 Bug: Contant crashing for absolute no reason #2 Bug: Constant FPS drops #3 Glitch: Sometimes I can't move the camera but I can move the character. EDIT: Gonna change it to 2 stars, it always lags out even though i have bad wifi, they didnt even fix the crashing bug. Games are so good but so bad handling with servers."
749,750,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Ephemeral Moth,"Very fun, and easy to play with. Has so much experiences, and glitches you can do. There is nothing bad with this game, well.. Just one thing. I dont know if it's just me, but in some experiences, it lags a lot.. I get annoyed by this a bit. I dont know if its my wifi, or what. Overall, this game is great. 4/5."
750,751,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Dahalia Samuels,"This is a awesome game but there are too much online dating and people asking and sharing personal information. I think that hackers should not be in robot, because it might cause people to be scared and delete the app or stop playing. And sometimes when I'm in a Brookhaven in a house there are zombies at the window and randomly other things too and when a friend is with me they don't believe what I am saying. IDK WHY THEY DON'T SEE WHAT I'M SAYING. Thank you for your time."
751,752,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Hannah White,"This game is really fun and I have been playing it for a few years, but One issue is that if I freeze, once I un-freeze when I try to move my camera it zooms in and out, not allowing me to move my camera. It's pretty annoying so if this can be fixed, I would be very happy. Other than that issue, great game! Totally recommend it!"
752,753,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Soumya,Roblox is a different kind of game like its amazing we can play various kinds of game its not like other boring games. Yeah but there's a issue too that when I try to play any game my screen gets stuck or we can say it glitches and when I play a shooting game the screen lags a lot so pls solve these probems. Besides I always love to play Roblox💓.
753,754,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,3,Sherakee Skeem,It is an amazing game but there is a bug that happens all the time the screen freezes but when u touch it or like try to move your character it zooms in and out and when u try to walk it does not move at all and if u reset your character it does not fix it and it happens on mobile a lot!!. I hope u fix this bug it would help a lot.
754,755,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,2,xx4931xx,"A somewhat decent game is here, but many things keep it from being great. A couple bugs have been showing itself: camera can't move right, chat only appearing as ""____"", and after playing a game for a while it tends to have constant frame-rate drops (as in 54 fps turns into less than 15 fps). Not to mention almost every game nowadays require a good device to play, otherwise load times are huge or sometimes a game is completely unplayable. This needs work..."
755,756,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Carol O'Steen,I'm not happy with an update made. It just started today. Where I used to see my friends list across the top of the screen. Now I see big squares with maybe 4 of my friends and what they're playing. Not my whole friends list and what they are playing. So frustrating.
756,757,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Margaux,"Roblox is an amazing game! You can communicate well here and I got an surprisingly good amount of friends bc of it! There's many problems I have with roblox but ill talk about the 1 that's been frustrating me, for some reason whenever I use the womans package and put other stuff I can't save the outfit? This caused me too redo my fit many times after changing it. I assume the problem is bc of the woman package, it's easier to just record it and explain but still pls fix it!"
757,758,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,3,Joy Watson,"Super laggy app over all. Games are cool but whenever I click on a game it take like an hour to load. Then there's a black screen which takes quite a while. And after all that waiting, the games don't feel as good as I thought."
758,759,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,W. T. Webb,The reason I didn't get the zero stars because this is a really fun game I've been playing it since 2019 made me smile so much but the problems are there's no offline mode and just there's a bunch of people that can just follow you and swarm you sounds like really annoying and plus you have to update it every week but now but for some reason every time I play it it logs me out and then had to log in this is the problem I need to fix maybe it's because there's so many servers but the game fun
759,760,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Kelvin Horton,"The game will not work properly and when you move the character, at some point the camera will zoom in and out when you walk. That is very annoying please fix. The is still good but, has lots of problems. Edit: Bring back the ""oof"" sound before I throw a scene, I'm mad."
760,761,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,4,krystle roberts,"I would put five stars, but there is a glitch with the curser. When I zoom into first person the arrow gets stuck in the middle. When I use my mouse he arrow just goes to the left making it where I can't shoot currectly, chat or click on anything. I have tryed looking at totorials and they all say the same thing turn my display size to 100. It doesn't work. My divise is a Chromebook. Please help!"
761,762,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Maya Str,"This game is really fun and entertaining. I love the part where you can create mods and skins, and even join others in a n online roleplay and obbys, plus mods. But, the problem is is that everytime I'm in a good roleplay in Warrior cats, right in the middle I get disconnected. Its so frusterating. I loose all my progress and I can't join the same server again. This is the only thing you need to change. Otherwise, great game, and would have been 5, not 4."
762,763,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Touya Todoroki,"It's a really great game where you can explore and make friends!! The only thing I don't like about this game is that there's real online dating, hackers, and just creepy people in general. Definitely don't let younger children play until they're older like 10+ due to these things and parents you can manage your child's account to make sure they're safe on this game!"
763,764,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,Sophia Ricccardi,There's just so many games and it's really fun and it's just really cool just you get friends a lot of things I just don't know how to describe it but it's a really good app everyone should get it but there's just a little glitch because my screen sometimes just messes up so I hope they fix that
764,765,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,DaRiyah Robinson,"I rate this game a 5 star because there is really nothing to worry about but there are 3 issues which is when I try to get on the game it will say no connection even if I have full wifi bar and I would have to get off and reload the game so I can pick the server game I want to play another thing, when I'm playing the screen glitches and it goes in and out also sometimes when I'm walking the screen either turns when I turn my charecter and sometimes when I rejojn it doesnt go back to normal."
765,766,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Cesar Chavez,"I love it ,the only Issue I have with the game is sometimes ,your camera moving breaks and when you try to move it, it just zooms in or out.I dont know what causes this but i do know one way to fix it. Some games make your move your camera to a certain position right, well that actually fixes your camera if it starts doing that.For example,build a boat for treasure's camera in game. That make you look the way the camera is at, thus fixing it.And in certain rp games you can go to the avatar edit."
766,767,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,3,Marcus Frederick,"The game itself is amazing, 5/5, 10/10. But I put 3 stars because of the excessive amount of LAG and my phone spontaneously combusting at the seams. This game just seems to NOT like my phone, if you can please fix the performance issues."
767,768,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Ntsumi Mayimela,"I really do like it and I 100% recommend you to download it although it can be really annoying when you playing Brookhaven because you can't say some words like cute or adorable which can be really frustrating because it's not even a bad word, but anyway the best app ever"
768,769,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,LittleCat,"Great game, totally recommend but just one problem, some children I know who play this game have been influenced negatively, learning new curse words and I've also seen cases of racism and sexism when someone told a female player to go back to the kitchen??? I'm not saying this is necessarily all the games fault but it has been spreading a lot in the game, otherwise the only video game I like."
769,770,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Denise Ward,(I love it(around a year ago) Roblox is an amazing game and there's so many experiences to choose from. But lately it's been lagging since the new update. For example exiting me out of an experience for no reason. i even rebooted my phone.i hope this clears up soon.)it's been a week since I posted that review and I'm still having this problem.also there's a bug when your screen locks and it zooms in and out.its very aggravating an d I can't enjoy the experience with it.
770,771,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,5,Valtia pero,"The game is Kind of glitchy and crashes sometimes but overall it has pretty good graphics and games to play . Most of my favorites are Cos(creatutes of sonaria) , Rh , Adopt me and some more! Some games are based on Fantasy books, lore or school in real life! or stuff . But otherwise it's a pretty good game! I just upgraded the game. And it's genres are Rpg , Adventure , Fantasy & more , But one major problem. Mobile players cannot swipe their screen when they accidentally press on the rblx logo"
771,772,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,Someone,"Hi I am someone! I really like this game but I suggest you, the developers, to make the button for jump to be much bigger.. or maybe custom? So, the player can adjust the size into their liking. It's really hard for me to play the game in roblox especially at parkour, because the button is just too small for me... So please fix that, make it custom and I would really appreciate that. Just that from me, thank you!! I am so sorry, my English is bad, but I hope you understand what I'm saying"
772,773,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Xenia Stevenson,"This game is good, but it used to be better. When all the pokemon games where there, the game used to be even more funner than what it is now. And since you changed the OOF sound, it just doesn't feel the same playing. I feel alot of people might feel the same way, sad, that u guys deleted the old OOF sound and added another sound. It doesn't even sound like a sound. It's just BAH, or something. I feel you will get alot of hate from this."
773,774,2022-06-20,2022,06,20,5,Loke,"It's totally fun!! there's incrediblely many well-made games for you to play!! For parents : But there's a few things I have to mention before letting your child playing the game. Some of the games your children see in the recommendations might be inappropriate for your child's age, toxic people, scams links and more. Don't let them play for hours it will make your childs addicted to the screen. Have fun!!"
774,775,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,5,Keira Queen,"Favourite game for years. The game play is really great, and it's overall a decent community. The only downfall I am very saddened with; is that removed the multi-hair when creating avatars. As a person who has a lot of fun messing around with avatars, this is a big issue... very sad. Other than that, It's safe, secure, and a great place to be in my free time"
775,776,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Jonathan Maramba,"This game is so cool because if you think of any games in here, ITS THERE! But sometimes i hate people that scam and stuff so you need to add a scamming devices inany trading games. But then agian the games cool and i hope there are additional bug fixes! Edit:been the past few months and I have been encountering... Well problems. When I join roblox, I'm stuck in the loading screen which makes me rejoin it again. But everything is good so far! But some people are hate the new oof sound. Idk why."
776,777,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Ur Mom,"It's good, it's fun to play when your in the mood and it's one of the only games you can really play with your friends online that's actually enjoyable but it's constantly asking me to update it and it glitches sometimes, when I change my avatar it won't load unless I open and close the app a couple times and all the good things for your avatar you need to pay money to get robux for which is annoying because I don't always feel like spending my money on a silly kids game but I would recommend."
777,778,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,5,Danica Farnen,"Love it but sometimes when i accidentally click the button that shows people in the server or if you want to leave etc. it sometimes, when i try to change the way i am looking, it just makes it zoom in and out. Please fix this. Overall it is a wonderful game."
778,779,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,5,Samina Mansoor,"Hello, this is an awesome game and I play it on my PC everyday. However the problem is that when I'm logging in my account, PC or mobile, I enter my correct password, yet it shows that it's incorrect, after trying many times I finally login but its frustrating to keep entering the same password again and again. Please fix this. Thank you -Catwannabe"
779,780,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,James Smith,"The game is really good for its multiplayer ability. It has thousands of amazing games to have fun on. Even bad games can be exciting to play. There are loads of different people to experience fun with, on all sorts of games."
780,781,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,3,Ericka clare Tagaruma,"Hi developers, i know you're actively working on this, but there's a new bug. It doesn't let us see our friends and everything is blank. We can't see the popularity of the game, please fix this! (Edit) It's been a while since this was fixed and i didn't edit it yet, but thanks for fixing it!"
781,782,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Tessa Clark,"I play on mobile and when roblox is open already when I get on it never loads in even on full bars of service. Sometimes I even have to restart my device. But the game itself is amazing it has so many fun and wonderful games to explore and I also play on Xbox and they are right it does power imagination. I would give this game 5 ☆s but as you know from the beginning of the review, I've had some issues. But you should definitely try it."
782,783,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,Ines,It's my favorite game and it's super fun but.. there's one issue... When i play Roblox on my ipad I play adopt me when I play in a few minutes it freeze my screen and I can't get out of the game or do anything the only way is to turn my ipad off and return it on and then it's fixed but this issue happen only on adopt me but it happens on other games too so please Roblox fix this bug and hopefully you read My comment and have a great day!
783,784,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,Karina Quirarte,"This is the most amazing game in the world I would recommend it e except the robux part but there are so many incredible worlds and things to do you can even make your own avatar I love this game so much. But updates are a little stressful😡 in a way. I don't like it when I can't play it that's the most annoying thing but it's not its fault,it's the internets fault. Another thing is they won't let me update it. the only thing that I hate is it😡 is slow on updates and sometimes in the game too."
784,785,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Elmer Ulloa,"For the first time, I experienced what a 5 star game is. This game is bonkers. I love this game very much and would highly recommend it for anyone, there are no big problems and I don't care what people think of the new death sound, it's JUST a sound. I do want Roblox to fix this though. First up, when I am trying to play a game, sometimes it just lags out and force quit the game. I don't know why this happens. Fix it. Other than that, a solid 5 stars! Love it, and I hope they fix the problem."
785,786,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Yaneli Estrada,"I love this game, it has many selection and many different genres to choose from like scary games, family games, obbys and much more.but of corse there are still alot of games that are very glitchy. As much as I love this game there can still be some improvements that can be added. Also I don't know if this is just me but sometimes when I I'm playing for a while the game freezes alot and either stops working or it tells me to leave or reconnect.But overall a great game I definitely recommend."
786,787,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,4,Mysha khan,"They game is very nice! It has nice graphics, cool games and etc, but one problem that I have with is deleted shirts, I would buy a shirt and then it would later on get deleted, so my robust would end up being wasted. I think there should be an option to sell, your old robux items, since I have a lot of old items which I don't need! Other than that the game is amazing!"
787,788,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Frank Reliford,"Its my favorite app, but it does have some glitches that REALLY need fixing. Over all its great! So many games, really fun, but like other people who have this problem, my character will glitch and not move, but instead zoom in and out if I try to move. Please fix this so we can enjoy roblox again!"
788,789,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,coƒfɛe,"Awesome game! Really like the Avatar options and games,fun place to relax and play.... But there are a few glitches where when you purchase Robux/item it takes a long time to load it into your avatar,even though your network is working great. Otherwise I would recommend playing this game! Edit:- the app glitches too much on all my devices- It happens the same with my friends ;-;"
789,790,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,4,Kyuo Peirce,"I have a Dell Chromebook and it works but you have to choose your game online first because this app (the only one I could find for my computer) won't let you scroll through the games or any of your chats. However, after choosing my game online I can usually play no problem or with few, like certain buttons not matching up or the inability to scroll through tutorials."
790,791,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Leland Thau,"Listen, Roblox is great game! I like it, I ay it on PC and mobile. But there is an issue on mobile. The screen glitches and you can't move, it just zooms in and out. It would've been a 5 stars if this wasn't an issue. I've grown up with this game since 2010. So if you're a newcomer to Roblox, I 100% recommend it."
791,792,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,ᑕしᝪᑌᗞᎩᝪᑕᗴᗩᑎ,This game is family friendly and has lots of fun games to play. I recommend to anyone looking for a fun game or someone just curious about playing it. You can create your own Games Through Computers or laptops. Edit or customize your Avatar. There are free things and things for robux. But best of all it is for all Ages your never to old to play a game like roblox!
792,793,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Jaymy Taylor,"Super good!!!! Although a couple times i haven't gotten my robux from purchasing. It did quite upset me. I spent a little bit over 50$ on robux for myself. I spent it and it didn't even say ""purchase cancelled"" or whatever, i looked at my paypal balence and 50$ was abducted. I didn't have my robux either. I refreshed multiple times and still didn't get anything. I even restarted my phone. Please fix this. Even tho this has only happened 1-3 times for me."
793,794,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,3,sarah retzlaff,"i dont know if it was only me but i have been being kicked out of roblox multiple times because of glitches and have alot of trouble with moving around in the game, overall i think roblox is a good game they just need to fix the little bugs and issues with the loading- please roblox fix this problem it'll be really good to play without having any issues : ) - sorry about the three star rating it was only because i want you to fix it fast"
794,795,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Tracy Larose,I like the game generally it's really fun and lots of cool games to play!!! My only problem is with the new free hairs. Their flat on the top and it kinda looks stupid to be perfectly honest. But the game itself is great
795,796,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,3,Apple Rey,"This game is really good, people can create games and play them. But theres just a few major problems. 1 everything is becoming too corperate compared to its old and fun playstyle full of crazy things you can do with physics. Now the newer games are fun but most dont have the appeal compared to before. 2 the moderation is not really good. 3 the game has really lost its touch with the community. Its becoming to corporate like and to be honest it removes one thing many people joined the game for."
796,797,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,3,dude man,"As someone who has played since late 2015, things have gotten worse. All the events are just music concerts for the most part, and if they aren't it's a name brand event. Not only this, but technically robux is worth more than USD. As example $1 (100 cents) can only get you 80 robux which is a little strange. Some other honorable mentions are: terrible moderation and constant server problems. Edit: there is also constant glitches on mobile for example when walking it zooms you camera in often."
797,798,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Nathan Sater,"Roblox is a great game.However, sometimes the screen glitches and when I try to walk, it zooms in and out.I play on mobile, and this was a problem for me since 2020 😕.Pls fix this! But still great game 😁. I have been playing Roblox since 2010!I would've given it 3 ⭐, but since I have played the game for 12 years I give it 4.Without this game I would be depressed forever!"
798,799,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,3,Edgar The Yt Gamer,Roblox is a great game but really not happy with it right now. Back in 2017 It was fun for me had fun with my friends but now it doesn't feel the same anymore. I still like but I wish roblox can do something about the problems. There are alot of scammers and people online dating. I'm sad they took the OOF sound away but I understand why but the game just doesn't feel right anymore. Please improve in the future. Still love the game just needs improvement. Still have fun:)
799,800,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Leszek Skrzypczak,"I love this app, you can play all different types of games that suit you. The one thing that can be annoying is whenever you don't play it for around a week, it says you need to update it which can take a while and have some difficulties. Other than the technical issues I love this app, and it is one of my favourites."
800,801,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,【konekochuz】,"There's a glitch where the joystick for moving stops working and you can only move the camera/scree . Also, there's one where you can't move your screen at all on mobile. Hasn't been patched yet and it's been there for a while."
801,802,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Evelyn Rose,"Roblox is a really fun game, I play it all the time! There are some bugs about it tho, when i'm playing a random game my screen goes in and out and it can't be fixed while still on the game, I know at least everyone has been through that! Also some games won't let me play? Idk if its just my Mc Donalds wifi but idk. thats all if ur reading reviews for the game its awsome!"
802,803,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,2,Edelweiss,"There are sooo many bugs in this game it's hard to play without cursing. There were times when I can't rotate the camera while playing one of those lengthy game and I didn't even want to restart because I was almost winning. Yes, I've tried everything but there's no other way to fix it than restart the app."
803,804,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,4,Miahdream Martinez,This game is really awesome but there's a problem I can't play bloxburg every attempt I freeze and my screen blacks out. Another issue the reports builder man or Roblox itself dosent read or check them which could lead to something bad actually happening. Overall this game is amazing I can unleash my creativity and express myself all sorts of ways! Hope you fix the bug I was talking about! Great game tho </3
804,805,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,Barry Trammell,"Its great! You can have creativity, fun, and more fun! Creative things you can make: Avatar, clothes, accessories, games, groups, and hats! You can even play other peoples games and wear other peoples creations! I highly recommend for people who like video games! There are soooo many games and you can enjoy it all with friends! You can even chat in games and chat with friends off of games! And it's completely save for small children 'cause there are certain things (like bad words) you can't say."
805,806,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,minty_artlover123,"The game absolutely extraordinary! I honestly love making new friends and having fun in each game i come across to! Although the problem for me and some others i've met have been having some trouble which on mobile, sometimes when your walking in the game you can accidentally click the chat button or settings which can make your screen weird. Hopefully this could be fixed but i love this game so much, you can chat with people, make new friends, play millions of games! The game cured my boredness"
806,807,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,3,Genevieve W,"Hello and Greetings developer. I wanna talk abt why I gave this game a 3 stars. 1. When I wanted to buy Robux , it doesn't let me buy it. And it tells me to top up my account. 2. The game lags alot. And me and my friends were struggling by the lag. We can't play any games and so we were forced to not play Roblox for 1 day. So developer.. please fix this bug. I would appreciate ALOT if you fix this bug. thank you Roblox."
807,808,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,1,LTON,"There is this annoying bug that makes your screen zoom in and zoom out and the only way to get rid of it is by leaving or rejoining a game, and for me it got even worse now it is happening more than it ever did and it is ruining my fun, if you could do something every mobile player would appreciate it."
808,809,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Hailey Dunville,This is an Amazing game it has so many games you can play over and over again I really recomend this game Especialy if your bored it may cost money to get certain things but atleast the whole platform doesnt cost any money I am one of those people that has for a couple years so I know quite a lot its a great game and the robux costs a good amount!
809,810,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Audrina Petsch,"Roblox is a wonderful game. It can be kind of laggy on mobile devices and the <13 chat filter might take some of your words and make them hastags (#). Also, when I update the app I have to restart my phone a couple times for it to actually load. The game is still good, but these are a few problems. Roblox is an overall really fun game full of other games (now known as experiences) that have been crafted and designed by other Roblox players. You should definitely try it someday!!!"
810,811,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Isabella Stearns,Roblox is a really fun game with multiple experiences it's just that sometimes when I try to changed my point of view it zooms in and out and it's VERY annoying I really do hope roblox fixes this bug. But besides that It's pretty fun!
811,812,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,Leiylah Lopez,Ok I have Been playing this game for 3 years and I never get bored playing Roblox I guarantee that this game will be amazing and the updates but in the future they need to fix all the bugs in the game like I don't know if it's just my computer but every time it freezes and I have to turn off and reset my computer for it to get off the page but either that it's still an amazing game there's so many games that you could choose! I've been playing since I was 10 and I never got bored playing it👍👍
812,813,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Maria Torres,"its a really good app to play on! i love it so much, it helps me play with my friends from school instead of just seeing them in classes. And I also meet new friends my age! 5 stars, Roblox has changed so much! its honestly scary, and from 2018 to 2022 its changed sooooo much!"
813,814,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Gigii_birthdahy lo,It is a great game but there is this one bug that annoys me. I went on Roblox one day and I was logged out of my account. (keep in mind that I save my passwords.) I tried to get in but it wouldnt let me. And there is this glitch where you screen gets stuck and it only zooms in and out. Other than that it is pretty good.
814,815,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Tamanna Tasmin,"I really like this game. I really cannot express it. I found this game while looking in the play store for a new game.It's so boring in covid-19 situation. and then I found this game and didin't know what this game was about. I read the about page and got really excited to play. OFC, I installed it, opened it then that's where things got confusing for me. I never thought games could have games INSIDE of games. and that's where I started. THANK YOU SO MUCH ROBLOX FOR MAKING ME SO HAPPY!!!"
815,816,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,InsaneSprinkle,"It's a really amazing game! It's okay for younger kids and roblox lets you use your imagination. It's really fun and some games you can create your very own magnificent creative land! It's no fiddly or anything it's quite easy. AND 80 robux is only 99p. And best of all, there's a TON of games! It's one big block with millions of spectacular, fascinating games to play. But, I couldn't give it a 5 star because sometimes it spins your screen or doesn't allow you to jump or move. Overall, excellent!"
816,817,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Lola Stewart,"For some reason I keep getting kicked out the app, whenever I try to open it the loading screen will apper but a few seconds later the app will just close no idea what has happened but whenever I play any game it's been super laggy and I have been disconnected alot even though my wifi is perfectly fine. If you could help me or take a look at it, it would mean alot thanks!"

818,819,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,1,Autumn Cooper,"As of lately everytime I get on roblox, I can't even do as much as to get into my home screen because it says on the roblox loading screen, entirely frozen. This has happened ever since I've updated the app and it has been a big problem, I've spent a lot of money on this game and it's a waste at this point since i can't even access the game. I checked to make sure my account was deleted and it wasn't, I've reinstalled the app numerous times, and nothing has worked"
819,820,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,4,Matcha_ Tea,"It's a good app I just have one problem, and that's with movement or screen movement. For like the first 5 minutes it's pretty normal then my screen glitches and I can't look around or move my camera, I only can zoom in or out, I've tried massing with the settings but it dosent work. Idk if I'm the only one experiencing this vut it's pretty annoying."

Sometimes our screen doesn't rotate it only zooms in and out, and sometimes it kicks us out of the game! Please fix this and I'll give a higher rating."
821,822,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Chad Laird,"It's overall a amazing game, but when I'm on my laptop and it's not touch screen. You use to be able to in certain games where on mobile you could fly but on my laptop to fly you use to be able to go higher if you pressed the down arrow that doesn't work anymore and now you can only do nose dives when your only 2 feet above the ground and hover on my laptop. It's really anoying."
822,823,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Leon Taha,"5 stars for mobile, 3 stars for computer, correct setting on mobile makes this game very fun. But when i download this game from google play, it thinks im on mobile so i cant play computer games even though im on computer and the mouse gets stuck on the corner of the screen maybe because it still counts outside of roblox but i dont think this is the games fault, fix not being able to play computer games on computer and ill play computer so much more."
823,824,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Aarush Tendulkar,"It's a really good game but since the 2022 update, the game has been randomly disconnecting me after 15-20 minutes of gameplay. If it's a feature for children, i have consent from parents. Please either have an option to disable it or remove the feature. Even after many people reporting it, roblox hasn't taken any action. Seems like it is careless about its customers."
824,825,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,Mimi,This game is amazing! it has so much games to play and it's very fun 😀 u should download it and play it it is just Incredible that how many games there are in this one. U should download it and then share it with your friends and play with them 😉 . It's a very good game but it needs a new update. not in the games that are in the actual game . But that's it and u should download it will be very fun! (Part 2) As I said it's amazing! But they should add more girl nice looking hair for free!

It has happened a few times now and I have no choice but to leave because it's wacky"
826,827,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Ola Goodluck,Ok its been 1 month and still the game hasnt turned out like among us now there is one thing that really anoys me and its because its useless 1. The game needs updates every 1 or 2 months even though nothing about the game changes and it wastes my storage so i ask if the game can update so atleast the graphics will change once or make it so that you can set up a thing that lest you remember your password if not 3 stars it is
827,828,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Warren Hamm,"It's hard to get bored. But 60% of the content is bad because people just uploaded random stuff. But luckiley there is a rating system. other than bug's\glitchs, annoying player's, and etc. the game's awesome."
828,829,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Silvina Nestarez,"Its a 3. Don't get me wrong. I really ūsed to like this game; I mean, there is everything you could possibly want to be, and you can have as many friends as you want. But... thats the problem. It creates lots of addiction. And soon enough, all the hate or pressure in the game will create depression. And if you dont control your time with this game, it wont be good. I'm not saying you can't play, or making a living out of making Roblox Videos. But, theres an actual life for you out there."
829,830,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Kamoryn Backman,I really love this app but the last few days it's been very glitchy. And in adopt me I'll get a rare or ultra rare item and it disappears the next time I log on. Or in a adopt me I'll buy or trade something and those items will also be deleted. In other games the glitch will move me backward or in meep city I'll be under something instead of on it when I sit down. I play on a couple different devices.
830,831,2022-08-23,2022,08,23,4,Lilah Loveland,I love the game and all. Recently I've been having issues with it. The other day I couldn't get onto my account due to my email not working. Today I go to play and I cant log jn. I press forgot password that doesn't work either. I asked my sister to try add my account and it says its unable to do so. I've emailed multiple times now and got no help! I tried another of things to get back into it but this is a joke now
831,832,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Scott Lean,"My favorite game but it has some infuriating glitches including: when I join and leave too many games and then join another, it'll make me stuck in this shiftlock-like mode. When I'm walking and then press the Roblox icon in the top left corner and then get off that screen, when I walk, the camera will move. And tons more"
832,833,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,2,Ashlyn Walk,I love the game but there's is a problem that has bothered me a lot. When I open the avatar editor it just leaves me at a white screen. I thought it was just my phone and gave the game a break only for it to do it again. It does this every. single. time. I've even reinstalled the game twice and nothing changes. Fix this please.
833,834,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Monica Davis,"This game is amazing, but there is a bit of lag from time to time which is why I didn't give it a 5 star review and plus there is yes a lot of games but some are just titled the same thing as another game and it would be nice to change it to one name that isn't the same as another so yeah. Edit 2: Roblox has gotten way better and their are more creators which is nice also one of the best games for PC and Mobile. Keep it up Roblox😄"
834,835,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,patato nato,I love how everybody can Collab with each other and meet other people. Everybody has good creativity in the games. And with the games. The only problem I have is that my screen freezes up and I can't do anything but move my avatar. It only happeneds then and there so I would love if you guys fix the bug<3. Anyways pretty much I love this app!!
835,836,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,YourLocalAxolotl,"Roblox is overall a fun and enjoyable game! you can make your own avatars, games, and so much more :D but when they removed multiple hairs and some popular items without refunding people it drove a lot of creativity and players from the game. Honestly I understand why they changed the oof sound. They got copywrited. But why upset even more people by taking stuff out of the game? hair is one of the most important to most people so that also decreased their money since people are spending less."
836,837,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Zone Mobi,"This game is really good for everyone to play it , also i wanted to put 5stars but i didn't want people to think ima bot so i put 4 instead , sometimes bugs can happen but thw community is taking care of them it , the app also can help u communicated with other people and have online friends Hope u all play it , its amazing with all the graphics and more"
837,838,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,•Galaxy Pancakes•,"Roblox is a really good game! Besides one thing. Also to note that my internet is fine. When i join and play a game for too long, for a bit it will be ok. But then out of nowhere, it kicks me out of the game for my internet. I join back in. It kicks me off for my internet as soon as i join. All other games work fine. Just that one game that i join. Kicks me off for internet issues. If you guys can fix this, I will give you five stars. Thx for reading this out :)"
838,839,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Sophie Wallis-Moore,"its a good game , lots of games to play but they could change some stuff like for example a. the money thing as it takes forever to understand how to pay , you just need to search up google and on roblox , sign in and press pay [ i think ] then it should let you pay .. b sometimes you can glitch on phone or tablet or any devices which gets so annoying [ i glitched out of a game ]. but yea its amazing you can join friends but voice its kinda hard on roblox so i suggest use a different device"
839,840,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Ella Baay,"Roblox is a super cool game, but I have 1 problem. Sometimes when I play, when I accidentally sent to other apps, when i come back the camera view sucks. Sometimes I got stuck in shiftlock. That's all, overall this is AMAZING!"
840,841,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Alyssa Lam Shang Leen,"It was fun to play roblox as you can interact with other people and it is fun there is also many varieties of games. But, it can sometimes get people addicted. But overall it is a very good app for games. Thank you to whoever created this game. I love it! ❤️😍😊I think everyone should download it. It is super worth it."
841,842,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,4,Rebekah DeMars,"Such a great game! There are a variety of games and you can make favorites. Games always get updated, and roblox listens to peoples feed back. The only thing I've noticed lately is that it is unconsistent of how long it takes to load into a game. Focusing on adopt me, could someone fix the lag where when I walk through a door my pet disapeers. Also, I played Field Trip Z and I spent 35 robux to respawn. Then I immediately died the second I got in without a chance to do anything. Please fix lags!"
842,843,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,5,Layan Islam,"This app is very fun, i love it! Sometimes it lags.. But its okay! The only problem is, Sometimes when i play games it wont let me in and i check my WIFI and the WIFI is very nice. Please fix the problem :( Oh and also mobile problems. My screen zooms in and out, hope that can be fixabile!"
843,844,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,ROBLOX PLAYER,"Honestly, this game is one of the best games I have ever played! But there are some downfalls about it. Those downfalls are how laggy games could be and sometimes you can't even find a game you searched up for. Sometimes you can't even join a game because your not on mobile or on a computer. In some games there is magic type abilities and sometimes those abilities don't work for people."
844,845,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,Sylas Vandenberg,"The game is fun overall but on mobile the screen can glitch. You can creat your own games but you need windows. The simulaters are fun and obbys are fun but some take a long time. Tycoons can either be fun or annoying some tycoons if you dont pick a good base you get bad weapons. Playing on keyboard and mouse there usaly isnt a problem. Some of the funnest games in my opinion are,bloxburg,retail tycoon,and 3008. Thank you for reading my review."
845,846,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,5,Princess Misszvvv,"best game ever! There is a problem, if I try to play smth I want to, it always zooms when I walk, so I have to rejoin, Number 2 promblem, is the jumping glitch, Because when ever if there's a jumper glitch I always have to touch the Leave, reset, resume, Button, So that it will stop but I still love this game when I was 6 yrs older, does that explains and I love this game very much 😍, and please fix the bug or something because I hate the bugs, Goodbye, (from Lexi-Sunshine)"
846,847,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,3,Christopher Cann,"Ok, its an awesome game, but my only problem is the lag. I constantly delete a LOT of data for the game to stop lagging, but it won't work. I tried refreshing the game many times, but it wont work. And most of the time, even on pc, all the clothing I would have on wouldn't load in correctly, sometimes not even the body type would work. Its an overall good game on xbox or pc, but otherwise, mobile needs improvement."
847,848,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,2,Juan Arroyo,"I used to like this game, but the later I started playing it gets annoying there's a lot of mobile problems. sometimes it glitches the zoom in so when u drag ur finger up and down the screen it doesn't turn correctly. I've been experiencing this alot lately, and it's so fustrating! I'll be playing like mm2 or something, then for some reason it glitches. ALSO I literally can't explain the lag? It's so laggy on mobile. I remember it not being as laggy back then, now it's extremely laggy."
848,849,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,5,Julis Beech,"I love this game, so overall; 5/stars! But i've had some issues with this. 1: I've been lagging a lot in the game, and no, it's not because of the graphics. 2: I have seen many Bugs whereever i go in the game. (Causes lag to me aswell) 3: When i play WCUE, it come's to the point where i cant move around a lot like i used to. 4: Apparently, the wau i've expirienced lag a lot, is because that my Laptop is not that old, i've had to sor like about, say- 3 Years. Im sorry if this turned into a rant!"
849,850,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,4,Veronica -Avocados from Mexico-,"My freinds had this game... at first I thought I would not like it but, I actually love it!! For those of you who dont know this game, this game is actually a whole bunch of games made by people who play this!!!! Available on almost every device, and you can make your own games on apple or window computers. Edit: sometimes I am in games and it's rly glitchy. Makes sense tho, depends on the games. So keep that in mind. Edit 2: the chat filter is really annoying sometimes"
850,851,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,3,Analiza Sabinada,"I really like this game, but i have two concerns. First, there are a lot of forbidden words, i understand why did u forbid those words, but it became a burden of communicating to someone. Whenever i'm trying to communicate to someone it always has an asterisk, so please, fix this. Second, it is always updating, but instead of having a good and better game, it is just become super lag."
851,852,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Hi,"I like Roblox, but it glitches way to often, my camera freezes in place and I can't move it and it's so frustrating when I'm in the middle of a game, and most of the time I can't open Roblox and I have to restart my phone for it to work. It's a good game but it can be really bad sometimes."
852,853,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,Hamid FARRAJ,"I absolutely love this game. Its a great experience for kids to learn how to: trade, be nice and respectful to people online; and always look out for bad people. I gotta say, it is quite addicting. But! At some point, you come to control your addiction. I've been playing for two whole years now. I've NEVER got bored of it. And I dont attend to."
853,854,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,A Google user,"I have plenty of problems in the game, everytime I play experiences longer, the game randomly force stops. Also, My biggest problem is Rthro avatars, it's so disturbing and they pop up in my nightmares, just delete Rthro."
854,855,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,5,Rania saqib,"Excellent app , it lets you play , create , design and many more you can join any game . Almost all the games are free and there are a few games that are locked and require robux but thats fine . Its laggs alot in a few games thats a bit annoying otherwise its fantastic. You can design your avatar however you want and you can play and chat with your friends too! Thats too cool!"
855,856,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,DEANNAOCASIO,"I love roblox, super fun game! All I wish was that the verifying your age to use voice chat was easier. I put in all of my info and provided photo evidence as it told me to and it said it was good then when i came back to use voice chat everything was gone and it looked as if i never verified my age and Im not trying to do it all again because it was difficult and time consuming"
856,857,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Tash Oko,"One of the best mobile games about adventure I have ever played please add more updates to your platform there are some glitches that make me stuck into shiftlock in each game or it may produce bundles of lag, but other than that it is a very great game."
857,858,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Tingdong Siao siao,It's a very fun game and a wide and has many games by many different people who makes them and the reason I gave a 4 star is because there is many toixc people and there's a glitch which roblox needs to fix its the screen on mobile it makes ur screen zoom in and out when you try to turn it bugs me alot and don't get me wrong this game is amazing i still play it but it has so many online daters and toixc people
858,859,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Amora Wheeler,"Great game! I love how you can play with friends on millions of experiences! However there are a few problems I would like to point out. 1: by far the worst-scammers, people get cheated out of hours of work and real money 2:creeps-sure the game is good for kids but so many weird adults try and be ""friends"" with the kids. However you can use the disable chat option! 3:I'm trying to update it but it keeps reseting when I load it up again Over all a really good game that I definitely recommend!"
859,860,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Brandon Zarate,"It's a good developed game yeah yeah but one specific things pisses me off. It doesn't matter what game, I don't know if it's a bug or lag or idfk but when I like sometimes zoom in to first person my screen movement bugs out and whenever I try to look around it zooms me in like can you fix that? It's very very annoying then I have to leave the game and rejoin sometimes it even happens when I join back like bruh 💀"
860,861,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Kiel Kirstienne Tria,"I'm experiencing fine in my Laptop/PC, However in mobile; It is very frustrating to use. Sometimes I cannot move my camera then after a few seconds, it starts shaking. Then, My jump button delays or dosen't work. Friend button dosen't work also. +plus verfication sometimes dosen't have an answer. OVERALL, my experience with thia game is awesome. It just need to be fixed; and its contribution on fixing it is just quite bad"
861,862,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,4,soap,"I love this game! I enjoy playing this game with my friends and younger siblings, also with meeting new people, yet I have experienced some problems lately. Roblox has been pretty laggy for me and I've been kicked from several experiences. Also, my profile won't show up (which I don't find much of a problem). I also have a hard time moving my screen, to the point where it won't move at all, and sometimes even moving my character."
862,863,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,シVc,"I have been playing Roblox since 2017 and it's really a fun game. Nice graphics, nice hair and clothes, but the only thing that I have a problem with is the tags at first it was a problem but as time went on it started getting frustating. Because recently I have noticed that even saying simple sentences gets tagged and it's really annoying and hard when trying to talk to friends and all that comes out is ""####"" but none the less great game"
863,864,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,3,Andi Nogar,"The game is fun but theres one problem when im going to costumize my avatar its always lagging and i dont know because of my phone or its just the game, and one more when im going to play something it lags a little and when im playing an obby i was just jumping until it keeps jumping and jumping like it wont stop even if im not clicking the jump button but i still like it!"
864,865,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Emi,"Their is so much to do in this game. I would definetly give Roblox 5 star, of course - their are some flaws. Some of the issues with this game are just small glitches, but overtime, they get fixed. Its a great platform with thousands of games, and its a really fun way to create your own game. I would recommend this game to anyone!"
865,866,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Jose Dalinog,Very good game. But my problem is Everytime I play it it crashes often And I can't play the other games in it because of the lag.and could you please make all clothes free because we were supposed to express ourselves and be anything we can imagine.That's all
866,867,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,4,Marg,It's a pretty good game. the experiences is fun and their simulators! but I have one small problem when your playing a experience and you accidentally clicked the menu while playing after that you closed the menu the camera got sticked it's pretty annoying it always keep happening and this bug is for mobile players.
867,868,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Milena Celebic,This game is great it's the best way to communicate with past friends and to make new friends there's only 2 problems 1.camera bug/Camera bug is where u can't scroll around at all 2.bullies/ there's always a few bullies but I definitely recommend this game for all ages also if u could make robux free it's a bit much but it needs to happen
868,869,2022-07-03,2022,07,03,4,Wedj Balingit,"Theres this glitch where your camera just randomly breaks and gets stuck. Sometimes, it locks and you cant rotate your screen. It's really annoying, even more so whenever I play a shooter game. Please fix this, since this bug has been here for about a year now. Edit: I also forgot to mention the camera gets stuck on shift lock when you play a game where you can shift lock. (I play on mobile btw)"
869,870,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Rghye Martinez,"overall, I think it's a really good game but it has some pretty major bugs. On mobile if you accidentally put your palm ir more than 2 fingers on the screen, you can no longer move your camera around, whenever you use 1 finger to look around it just zooms in and out. if this major flaw was fixed this would be full 5 stars."
870,871,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,April Hartsock,"This game was great 4 years ago. I just do not understand why you would add all these extra things we don't even need. It's now extremely confusing. I know it may be stylish, but it's a little bit too much now. The shoes, the shorts, all that. You don't even need to put shoes on the character. Just think of what disturbing and disgusting things kids may find with those combinations. I'm not over exaggerating but it's just gotten too out of hand. Overall, this app is awesome."
871,872,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,3,Mac Hollow,Over all a good platform for all ages to play and make games. There is a few bugs and gliches that have been a pain for most players over the years that havent been fixed. After the last update the game will kick you out at random times and sign you out of your acc. Also very hard to use on cromebooks.
872,873,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Mackenzie Callis,"it has millions of games on this app and you get Roblox currency which is called robux. you get 80 robux per $1.00. You can change your looks and outfits with robux. If you play this game you will have the greatest time. it is a very fun game and you should try it! I have only one issue. It's that some times it lags which makes you not able to move your screen or when you walk your screen follows it weirdly, but other than that it's a great game."
873,874,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Isaiah Judkins,"The game is great no doubt its just one problem this game is so easy to glitch when you go to a game you could fall through the map. But overall a really great game nice controls, Great graphics, however the glitching the game needs to be worked on. Peaple like my cousin do this and it frustrates me so please developer fix this"
874,875,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,3,Ellie Nakimbugwe,"If I could I could give half but the problem is that it keeps glitching me out of the game when I'm trying to play a game , it does it at certain times please help! By the way this game is my childhood and I've played it since I was 6! And this game taught me my English better than school, love you roblox!"
875,876,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Camila,"It's a nice game. But it glitches quite a lot and if I accidentally swipe up it zooms in and out. It sometimes really annoying, but other than that it's a great game, you get to meet new people, do new experiences and it's kinda educational. Thank you for your for reading this."
876,877,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,2,emskie,Very nice bug. I don't know the name but I call it swipe glitch or swipe bug and I don't know why it happens. This glitch mostly occur when sudden fast tapping or holding for too long or just tapping the setting button ingame. The most annoying part is the aiming touch was COMBINED with the joystick panel as this bug does the thing. Pls fix this
877,878,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,4,Jah'Lanni Booker,Its a really fun game that you play inside of games and you can play with friends and family or you can play alone I love this game most of l bc of how many different categories there are these horror there fun games the role plays and many more along I love It. My only issue with this game is how to loads I like it but it's a bit slow j would like that fixed but otherwise it's grat!
878,879,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Noelle Salazar,"I like this game, it has millions of worlds, but why four star ? Well, i only have two issues, one is the camera glitch, it sometimes happens to me, and my other friends who played roblox, second is the lag, idk but even though i have plenty of storage, my screen sometimes freeze, but overall, it's great, if only those problems doesn't exist, hope you'll fix it soon<3 !"
879,880,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,4,Charlotte Harvey,"I love this game so much because it's just a platform but has sooo many games to play! It does sometimes freeze and is hard to move the camera around to see. I also think that some more outfits and clothing choices should be free and not needing to be payed for. Overall, it's a pretty good game with many choices to pick from!"
880,881,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Purplely kim,"This is the best game out there in my opinion, LIKE its my favourite after all. But there are some problems that happened to me like, It lags so much on mobile and when I was gonna play roblox one day, I couldn't join in so I had to login with my previous account then. It was really sad, all my friends, my followers and all the things I've done in it. So could you fix this roblox? I've lost everything."
881,882,2022-06-19,2022,06,19,4,Eman Alfraihat,"Roblox is an amazing app! There are tons of games, you can connect with friends, and create many things. The only problem is that sometimes when trying to turn your screen, it zooms in instead. That needs to be fixed but otherwise, the app is pretty great!"
882,883,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Eddy Munstah,I love this game I have been playing it since it came out but there is one issue when ever playing a game mostly Brookhaven the screen glitch it's like I can move only character movement and its annoying pls fix it otherwise I love the game. But fix that on problem.and also as I was reading the reviews multiple people have had the problem not just me.
883,884,2022-07-12,2022,07,12,4,Hazel Reyn Ambrocio Tolentino,"Well done roblox! Im glad youre finally making the free hairs good and not actually ok designed, but theres 1 thing that i hate about your game, its that whenever i join big graphic games like sunsilk city after a few minutes my screen would be pure black, i have to exit the game to play again which is annoying. Please fix it, i would appreciate if you will."
884,885,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,2,Shiyo,App Crashes all the time. It crashes whenever I play a game or teleported to another game. There's like a 70% chance of it crashing and a 30% chance of actually letting you play. I know full well that the issue is not my phone nor my WiFi because I've seen devices with lower specs play this game effortlessly without crashes on the same Internet connection I'm connected to.
885,886,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Hendrix,I really recommend this game because you can explore millions of billions of games in one single game that's just beyond any single game I've ever played like obviously this is a five star for me but there is this one bug which like it freezes your screen for a while and then like a couple minutes after your screen goes crazy and you have to leave the game even if you reset it won't work and it will still be going everywhere so if you could fix that that would be great but overall this game top
886,887,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,lizzee manson,"Roblox is a very, awesome! Awesome! Game but on the other hand` alot of issues happen to me. Like a lot of other people, I know roblox does do a lot of updates. But the one thing that would appreciated being updated is the issue problem. That's all I would like to say! Thank you so much roblox for letting me join your awesome. fun. And any age game. THANK YOU!!! Oh! And if I may. I might have to share some other things with our wonderful roblox player's. Ok! So to our player's in a other text."
887,888,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Lynn Henry,"Edit again: I hate to say this but sometimes when I'm in some games. Games don't work like if it's a game where you have to interact, sometimes you can't click the buttons and you have to click it harder. Or a thousand times. And when you try to move the screen kinda gets stuck, I'm on mobile. I hope this gets fixed pls."
888,889,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,The B's Food,"Last time I wrote a review about roblox was in 2019. My opinion hasn't changed much, to be fair. As time goes on, so does Roblox. The age rage has changed, the games have adapted, and Roblox is a MUCH different website than the original. Things have elolved, and if you meet the right people and join games that you think are genuienly fun, it's an amazing experience. Of course, some people are toxic and ruin certain features, but that's just how things are in life. Overall, amazing app. :)"
889,890,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Melanie Moore,"So, in my opinion, Roblox is a great game all around. Great games, avatars, and so on. But a few problems with it. First, I really do not like how people make games and it automatically bans your account. It is quite unfair for people who did'nt know that it would happen. Second, I would like for people to be able to create games on mobile. Like I am trying to create an anime game, but I can't since I am on iPad, and I don't know how to code on PC. That is all, and in general, love it."
890,891,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,4,Frisk -_-,"Great game, and while the graphics are better and some games arguably got better, and the other flaws are from the community itself (But to be fair, the entire game relies on the community), I can't just ignore some flaws, example, the chat filter. It's pretty flawed. But if we ignore the bad side, this game pretty much gives you a huge possibility of..anything. From just a simple obstacle game, to house tycoons to literal horror masterpieces such as The Mimic. Flawed but worth trying out. 4/5."
891,892,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,2,ø,"2 stars. why? because first of all, whenever i want to play it kicks me out. Fix this, please. Second of all, whenever I actually can play (which is like once a year.) it lags so much, i cant even walk a stud. And lastly, there are 10+ inapropriate games, and 10+ racist games. I do not accept this behaviour of inapropriation and racistion. Thats all, get real"
892,893,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,3,Virginia Lane,It's a good game but its very glitchy and laggy.. Can robux be cheaper if you have a subscription or on holidays?? It would help a lot of people.. Also if I have something that can't be worn or used anymore can you just take it out of my inventory and give me my robux back please?? Because i spent the money to have robux if I spend it on something and then it can't be worn I want my robux back.. But overall other than that i think it's a good game to play.
893,894,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,1,Carissa Cheng,"Okay, I don't get it, You guys haven't fix the bug, I request it a few months ago, it's still like this! Whenever I go to IHOP training, It kicks me out to the Roblox logo page! And neither my phone is old or not, It's not old. And this bug is still here going, It's happening to me and my brother, I feel like you guys are ditching me and my brother. You guys are making me very sad for no reason, Can you guys please fix this bug, I would give it back a 5 star if you do."
894,895,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,Trey Hunter,It's an amazing game except it's not that amazing when your screen locks on display mode. (Even if I have it turned off!) Would rate it 5 stars of this didn't happened all the time.
895,896,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Stale pizza on my kitchen floor hill,Love it so much a few bugs here and there but great there are some problems though I think that there should be more curly hairs like afros (that aren't for a joke) and more realistic coily hair to represent all people's hair types also I hate the 3D clothes but that's not the point. also I keep getting disconnected even though my bars are perfectly fine
896,897,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,5,Irie Pacheco,"It is a great app it is perfect when lockdown cuz you can see your friends in Roblox, you can edit you character,but a lot of things cost robux and you have to spend half of your money for rubux. but it has little games for you can play add friends and chat!!!!"
897,898,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,3,Francheska Arsenio,"It's a good app it has lots of games in it but the problem is the camera, sometimes the camera just like it not moving anymore only the character it's annoying cause you'll have to rejoin and sometimes your camera will be not moving again it's so annoying,plus when I'm literally close to our wifi it just says 'Disconected' like what?!? I'm literally next to the wifi it's just annoying!,Please Fix this if you can thank you."
898,899,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,XxKitKatxX,"The game is good but they removed the oof sound and replaced it with a literal moan! Not even a good moan it is more of a suggestive moan. It is very inappropriate! If they bring back the oof sound I would for sure give it 5 stars. The oof sound made roblox what it is! It's like it's trademark! Aswell as this roblox is changing the character development too much. The game looked cool with it's lego-like characters. Overall, the game is great they just need to stop changing it. 3 stars."
899,900,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,5,Marcus Andrei Dellava,"I'd say you should fix a bunch of glitches that happens when you play the game, 1. The camera usually gets stuck while you play the game and you can move it at all 2. You can't move the camera anywhere and it gets stuck there forever until you rejoin 3. You can only zoom in and zoom out from this glitch in the camera. But overall this is a pretty fun game! Please fix these glitches to make the game much more better. Once you fix these glitches I would be happy. 😇"
900,901,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,5,Brad Graper,"It's an interesting game; it really needs to have a function where you can trade or give stuff to other players. Seriously, it does. And, it's not at all clear how high you need to build to get a rebirth. I built all the way off the top of the screen over the gage on the left and it resulted in nothing."
901,902,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,3,͡,Good app but theres alot of bugs on mobile. for example when you are sliding your screen then you click the roblox menu. the screen would freeze and you can only zoom in and out. and then if you are using the dynamic joystick then clicked the roblox menu. the dynamic joystick would follow your touch and would cause trouble.
902,903,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Katherine Willis,Me and my kids have been playing this for a couple years now and we still love it. Also love how you can create games kinda expensive for the robux though basically 1$ a robuck which gets pretty costly especially when you want to style your character. Also they need more choices on clothing and stuff. Also i dont understand why things i buy i dont have anymore whrn i paid basically real money for the robux. Kinda confusing on that part and wish the games had more of an explanation of how to play
903,904,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,MaddiexBear,"This game is very nice, although there is some lag/slowness in some games like : Loading into Bloxburg, Mall tycoon, Adopt Me, and Royale High. This is very minor, but it could be fixed. Great overal experience!"
904,905,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Kit Tjhoi Lee,"This is one of my favorite games, though it has a few bugs and glitches, you try to move on mobile and it zooms the camera in and out sometimes... Please fix this bug also the amount of hackers, scammers, toxic players, etc. If there is a way to get them away from roblox I'd like that. But... other then that i love the game. Though i think roblox should focus on the players experience more than the cash they get as i checked the rules of the game."
905,906,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Rama playz,It's fun but if you play a lot Its starts to get boring and you don't want to play the game. I think we need more honestly think that the metaverse to this game was a total Disaster.We need more hunts and like different Stories where there are different things we have to complete to find out whose behind the whole thing and who did that and so on. But we need more Fun events
906,907,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,michael MIAGUE,"I love this game so much! You can play games,have online friends and other cool stuff! I wouldve rate it 5 atars if the robux can be earned and not buy with real money and sometimes I get stuck with shiftlock too, Please fix this bug!"
907,908,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Rick K,I liked that there is so many experiences to choose from! The amount of small games makes it very fun! Sometimes though I can't move the camera so it makes it hard to move otherwise I think it is really fun!
908,909,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Summer Voss,"Amazing app! I have been playing for about 3 or 4 years now, I play it atleast once every day, and its such a great app to have, and the new voice chat update is really fun! Some games are also compatible with vr which is awsome! And the community..its just..great! Some people can be a bit negative and rude, but other than that, its such great fun, so many amazing games, and avatars, the catalog is huge!! There are so many options and ways to express myself! 10/10 app <3"
909,910,2022-06-26,2022,06,26,4,YourLocalWeirdo,"I rate this 4 stars, because its such an amazing game! Its based in real-time, with real people, and its so nice to play on because of that Edit: The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars, is because i play on chromebook, and its SUPER slow. My game often freezes, or slows the people around me down and then crashes. Sometimes when im updating it, it takes days to do, but i dont know why, and i dont have this issue on my phone. Im updating it as im typing this, so i hope it will fix..."
910,911,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,3,KITTEN PAWZ,"Some aspects definitely need work, regardless if this game is one of the most popular on the planet, the in menu chat needs something to make people actually know when you chat (if there is it needs to be more noticeable) and the whole ""experience"" thing is just wierd, they're games, everyone calls them games, they will always be games. Not a very big problem for me. I just think the actual menu needs some, refining."
911,912,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,3,chicalovepizza,"A few minor lags, but that's it. No music ID would work for me. Is that a bug? I loved this, and tbh I still do... BUT THE NEW DEATH SOUND SUCKS. Please, change it back! And, I keep getting kicked out randomly? It doesn't need updating? WHAT THE HECK ROBLOX- okay, I'm sorry... it just like, whyyyyyyyyyy"
912,913,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,4,Madalyn Leuschke,"The game is a great experience but randomly my screen will lock itself the only way I found out to fix it is by leaving, I also lag a large amount after a few hours of playing a game. I hope you can fox it roblox. The game is great to hang out with friends and chat with others. This is a great game."
913,914,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,5,Emilie Clep,"It is basically a mini playstore. You can learn stuff,hangout with your friends by chatting to them. You can like creators and support them, you can also create your own! There are simulators where you can do something and sell it to get a better version of the item you need. There are obbys where you need to pass obstacles to get to the end. There are tycoons where you earn money to go on buttons which makes something. I never get bored!"
914,915,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Alpha Jose,This game is amazing. You honestly cant get bored of this game because of its endless options to choose from. You can create your own roblox avatar and play countless games. The reason why this is a 4 star rating is because there are lots of bugs on the device i play-which is a mobile phone..and because of other problems that a lot of people have discussed..
915,916,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,Chirpy Little SiStars,"It has many games in it and if your wi-fi / data is good, your experience will be better than ever! Roblox has a wide variety of games from role playing to fantasy to survival games. Just type it out and if you are lucky, you will find the game that suites you. Roblox also comes with a currency called robux (which you have to use money to buy) with robux, you can have an even better experience you can unlock vip passes, cooler weapons and stuff etc. It is the best game ever!!! And I garentee it."
916,917,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Ryder Sparks,"This is a very good app, the only issue that I seemed to have is that whenever I would be touching the screen with one finger, and then press the pause button at the same time, it would glitch my screen. Whenever I'd try to move my screen it would just zoom in and out."
917,918,2022-06-04,2022,06,04,4,Robløxia 905,"Roblox is a great game although there are a few downfalls- it takes up a lot of storage and is quite laggy on mobile. Also on Xbox you simply cannot chat no matter how much you alter your settings, and certain games you cannot access on Xbox. Those two things need to be addressed but other than that I love everything else."
918,919,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,4,Serenity Marie,It wont let me upgrade but overall it's such a fun game I'm addicted you can explore different games and that is exciting. Really all I do all day if there's nothing to do is go on different games on Roblox. But I only have one problem and that is it won't let me upgrade so all I'm asking is to fix the problem. If you can't than that is okay I can deal without the upgrade.
919,920,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,shipokludoo,Amazing.Theres bugs though 1. The camera completely stops like in ''nicos nextbots'' I have to rejoin completely 2. Joystick stops working forcing me to use dynamic stick 3. Moving the camera stops it just zooms in and out 4. It usually says ''connection error'' I hate it.fix this and I'll give this 5 stars
920,921,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Vienna Fidler,"its an awsome game i love how you can play with friends and how you make new friends its great for kids i know this cause im a kid. i like the diffrent games. but there are a few problems. first, its really laggy. second, there should be more free items not many players have robux so its not fair. third, the updates take forever. thats why i gave 4 stars. you get rid of the bugs and make some more items free and speed up the updates. ill give 5."
921,922,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Stellaluna Moss,"I want to give it 5 stars, but there are bad laggs and glitches, sometimes my screen sticks so i can only go in and out, and the chat system keeps sending slow and making every chat just like this: Username:----------| its annoying, and at some maps ill be walking/running around and i fall through and my character resets, and some games ive waited hours (watched tv while left it loading) for it to load, otherwise great game"
922,923,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,3,Starr,"The Game is great, it has many games and options to play from which i really do enjoy. I have 1 problem though, The voicechat. Its unfair that you have to be 18+/13+ to get it. Some kids could have disabilities to type properly, or to read the words. I would like it if roblox itself could make it for all ages, only a guardians email or phone number should allow voice chat by text or mail. It should send you something like that and you have to allow it and do human verification. Overall 10/10."
923,924,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,5,I&Arianna Ibarrondo,I like the games you can play and I love the robux thing and all of the clothing it's like so good I give this a five star review I like hanging out with my friends in the game too. My brother likes to play shoot out a lot but I like the adopt me game this is a great game. It's the best. 5 stars crew. But the only thing I want to fix about it is the camera. Sometimes when no move my joystick the camera moves with it. Sometimes it goes in and out. Please fix that bug. 5 stars though.
924,925,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,5,Maryam Elhelaly,"It's really really really an amazing and enjoyable 😉 game . I have fun all time . I play it with my family and friends . I swear that u will not never ever say why did I install it . Have fun . But I have a problem 😕 that sometimes the camera zooms in and zooms out automatically and I hope u fix that problem. Second thing that we need an easier way to sign in instead of password, but this problem is now fixed . These are the only problems I had in the game and thank u so much 💓 💗 ❤️ 💖 ♥️"
925,926,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,Justin Branch,"I find this game amazing since 2011 when I first played made a guest account and enjoyed my lil self, Now 13 still playing this game but the game has some bugs. 1. Camrea bugs, 2. Shift lock broken. At some points shift lock bug is amazing at some point but gets annoying aswell because you have to close and re open the app witch kills alot of useful time. But that's all still an real amazing g and good game, I don't know about modrated and censorship just keep an eye out for your kid."
926,927,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,5,Brooklyn L.,"This game is o fun to play and the best part about it is that it has numerous games to pick from. For example, obbies, roleplays, mini games, you name it. Thank you for creating this amzing game for people to enjoy. :)"
927,928,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Peanut Butter Jelly Smash,"This game is very fun! I definitely recommend it. Although, when a popular game updates, roblox shuts down for 20-30 minutes. Also it could use some adjustments for example, the max friends limit because i want to friend someone in my server, but i can't because i have the max friends limit (200). Thanks for anyone who took the time to read this. Have a nice day everyone!!"
928,929,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,5,Brigette Wait,I totally understand. The reviews so yeah. If the Roblox community can fix that it would be so much more epic! The Brookhaven glitch is the worst. The one where you unlock your door and it starts to fly around. (I hate that glitch so so much). If they could fix that. Oh and the glitch where you can't get band in Brookhaven it is a bit anoyying so yeah (PLEASE FIX IT I BEG YOU). Cause it would be much more fun without the GLITCHES.💖😀 I've been playing for 9 Freking years love y'all.
929,930,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Lannah Slaughter,This is a very good app the only things i dislike is robux (probally bc i cant afford) if maybe there was a way to complete some kind of task to earn them that would be great! But games that are made should be looked at bc some arent kid freindly. Also most reports on drawing games are considered false if they draw smthn inappropriate but most reports are considered false and its soooo annoying.Otherwise its a great games to make freinds and just pass time in general.
930,931,2022-07-14,2022,07,14,4,Jehan Kelleth Ignacio,"its a good game. but it has annoying bugs, i know that all games have bugs, but to be honest this bugs r really annoying. for example, when i want to take a screenshot or screen record for something, after done, the screen will just bug and zoom in and zoom out when u try to rotate instead of rotating, tbh this is a usual bug and i need it for tiktok, and i cant do it in game bcos of this bug. please roblox, fix this bug."
931,932,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,4,Tessa Cail,"Ok so let's get to the point,It's a great game but has MANY flaws such as screen freezing, getting instantly put out of experiences then having to restart the app, and finally, when joining a game doesn't put you in an experience it only puts you into a empty server with the sky background BUT good news is for the screen freezing it only freezes when you do certain things such as putting the back of your palm on the screen and putting atleast 4 fingers at the same time on the screen."
932,933,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Angela Maiden,"It is brilliant, although there are quite alot of bugs (glitches) and you need the best internet if you want to play it. I think it should get updated alot more often. Since I play it, i know that is is not suitable for people under 6. Apart from that, I think that it is worth having the game! ~°~°~"
933,934,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,4,Chris Gosselin,"I love roblox! Only a few problems, sometimes it kicks me out and I have to make new account or it lags, it can be very annoying. When I get into a game after like 10 mins it kick me out saying I got disconected! If you can fix this pls do. Other than that I think this game is great! I reccomend it for sure! {Thanks for no ads!}"
934,935,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,chevalene Vava,"This is like a very good game where they are lots of games to p!ay but when we restart we have to login a do a hard puzzle but i even never do that kind of puzzle.Pls roblox fix it and make a better one ;( Oh yea and why odes everytime it needs an update, and if i just don't update i can't play the game. It's not like Minecraft, if you don't update yoy can still play the game, plase fix this i am running out of memory."
935,936,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,Ryder,"It was amazing at first, loved playing on my account and interacting with others. Then scams, child endangerment, hackers and much more have been popping up. I can't even play a game without getting logged put from some stranger who broke the system, Roblox has no support on fixing these issues. Reporting the user in game? Gets me banned instead. Reporting this via email? Too much. Two factor authentication? Bug that logs you out over and over forever. Protect the people, fix these issues NOW!"
936,937,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Buddy Hodge,I love this game but in adopt me sometimes it will just start a screm sound like eeeeeeeee and I can still play but it's loud even on 1 of volume that's why this is a 4 not a 5 but over all its super fun I get to play with friends and collect things in games I recommend this and adopt me on it 🌷🌷 it's fun but on Xbox you can't talk so I'm kinda mad about that but overall it's super fun!♡ there is so many games to play different genre's you can create a avatar to🦋 you can even make ur own game
937,938,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,4,Keira Wilson,"I absolutely adore the roblox experience. There is a lot I can say about little things to fix, sure, like how there are occasional bugs, but they are usually fixed very quickly, and nothing can out weigh the amazing nature of the plentiful supply of fun games, for anyone's personal likes. In other words, while there are some mistakes, nothing takes forever to fix. To add on, who doesn't like games on roblox? In all honesty I really recommend this game to easily bored people."
938,939,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,5,Kevin Miils,"I love Roblox, it's a great game where I can explore and see different experiences, but there's one problem, some people are hackers and can do stuff that normal players can't, so please I'd like if you fixed any sort of bug/glitch because I do not like that, and don't get me wrong I love the game."
939,940,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Mohd Syameer,"This is the reccomended game, so Roblox pls fix this bug: 1. Screen zooming problem, when i playing the game, sometimes when i move my screen it's glitching like i move to left it goes right. Plzz fix this bug. This game also the reccomended game in play store. Thank you"
940,941,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,3,0nc3Tw!c3F0r3v3r,"Love this game! The problems are moderation and bugs. When people don't follow rules, they don't even get banned! Second, bugs. Sometimes when I play the game my screen turns to all squares when I move. And it sometimes dosen't let me walk. Please fix these problems."
941,942,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,5,Arthur,"The game's amazing, the only problem is: Chat filter, and events. The game is not fun as in 2019, I'd like if you changed some things, now, the fact that you're forgetting R6...I'd give 4 stars, if you fixed all this the game would be perfect. Thanks for reading. :)"
942,943,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,2,Elio Abou mansour,"Well, recently I tried to open roblox like regular. But, it would keep stopping again and again,please fix it tho :/ Also,when I want to open roblox,I gotta close the app first, then play it, BUT ITS NOT IT! When I'm playing a game and try to move my screen, it will just zoom in,or it will think that my tablet is a computer,very laggy character customisation,and still needs a lot of work ngl. But its still kinda good Kinda"
943,944,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,2,Taylor Jeanis,"I find that Roblox is a very inspirational game. Though some games are found disturbing and laggy. I have 4 kjds. 2 teenagers, 9 year old, and a toddler. I let my kids play this game but find it annoying how some games require robux for purchase. Overall there's millions of games. There's horror games fun games educational games. My kids All love this app"
944,945,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Joe H,"It is really fun and entertaining but sometimes I wish some things were different. Like in some of the games I play. Also, there are so people who are really annoying like scammers in the games that I play! But overall it's a really fun game!"
945,946,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Alyssa osborne,"This game is pretty good, I have been playing for a couple years now and there is still nothing bad about this game. I occasionally have lag problems, but thats probably not robloxs problem, might just be the wifi. I recommend this game to people of all ages. The roblox comunity is very supportive and friendly. This game has a lot of variety, no matter what your into, you will find something you will most likely enjoy."
946,947,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Janessa Santana,"Ngl it's a really fun game. It's especially good for when you have a friend group. Even so, there are ways for kids to curse and say inappropriate things. And with the new mic thing that only makes it easier. But besides that it's really cool and you should check it out."
947,948,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,PancakesXDiva,"I really do like this game, in my opinion it is the best on the appstore. Me an my friend's love playing this game all the time. I wrote a reveiw previously about how there weren't that many free roux items and they had fixed that, I'm really glad knowing that Roblox does try to improve the game in an amazing way. And honestly there is no other game on my device that I'd rather play. I just can't stop playing it, it's too good. Hope you found this helpful. ;)"
948,949,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,Elizabeth Camacho,This game is great.i would give it a five stars but somethings off with my game everytime i join a game. every second i disconnected or kicked out of the game its really annoying to me i have no choice but to delete it and download it again. If this works again.
949,950,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Cary Hammond Creative,"This is fantastic game. It has entertaining games and can occupy you. If you play on a phone or ipad, sometimes the controls go abit weird, but just leave and rejoin the game and they are fixed. The tags on roblox are a bit annoying, but i get the saftey moderation. There are lots of fun games on the platform. Would reccomend."
950,951,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Youssef,Its a really good app u can find any kind of a games u wanna play and its my fav game so far. But there is a prob for mobile players like me cuz sometimes the screen glittches out and when u try to move it it zooms in and out instead of moving right and left up and.... i hope roblox fixes this bug it will really make the game better for mobile
951,952,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,5,charis stuart,It is a really good game. I have had it for over 4 years. I play on xbox and mobile. When I play on mobile it does some times lag and kick me of of the game. But other than that it's awesome also it's quite annoying that xbox players can't play some games..But I would recommend to down load it.
952,953,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,3,Macenzi B,This game is super fun and really awesome. The thing is if you try to create something you need to have an apple device or a desktop or Mac to create something and I find that really annoying. Another thing is that it can cost up to 100 dollars to get money in the game and that is really expensive!! The last thing is that people try to online date and take advantage of the fact they're dating so in some games they can team. It's just the online dating in general witch is not safe!
953,954,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Lana Aziz,"I really do like the game, but I don't play it as much now. Why I don't any more is because there is a bug and everything loads FOREVER and by the time it is finished loading I have to get of. It is really annoying, and lots of other people have this problem too they surely find it very annoying too."
954,955,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Amber,"This game is really fun, addicting, and weird, (in a good way) There are so many cool and fun games that make this game so unable to take apart for even just a short time. What makes it weird though is that their platform has terrible moderation and their community in social media is really toxic and unwelcoming. Best thing I can tell you try to be kind, and dnt really engage with ROBLOX players on social media, especially Twitter.."
955,956,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,5,Caleb Guzman,"This is THE BEST GAME I've ever played before, on mobile anyway. There's so many options and different types of games to play on Roblox and I never get bored, every bit is entertaining, even setting up my Roblox account was fun. There is only one problem I'd like to complain about, when ever you die on a mobile device and respawn, sometimes my screen will lock at the point where I can't move or look anywhere and I'm forced to leave the game since there's no trick to fix it."
956,957,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,3,Yariel Jafet Colon,"I think gonna quit roblox for good, don't take me wrong thus is one of the best games I've ever played but... literally like every 3 or 4 days it logs off and since last time it doesn't let me get back in the game, I'm putting the right user and pass but it still doesn't let me log in, and I'm really wanting to play some games for a long time, please do something"
957,958,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Athena McKenna,Roblox is a great game overall and a great way to interact with friends and new people. The only thing is that the rubux is very expensive and it's not as good without it.The clothing is very good and there are soo many styles to chose from! I really like how you can make your own games as well
958,959,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,4,Luan Yomoki,"I really love roblox, but the only problem is the same as the previous conversations or reviews. For phone users, they wont get away with playing slowly. Glitches, Black-outs, etc. Those things gotta change. Instead of testing it on PC, Laptop, and other devices that uses a keyboard and big screen for support. You need to test it on Phone and tablet users. Personally, I'm a mixed of laptop and Phone user. We all understand you need to work quick to let out the new update. But please, :)"
959,960,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Himaneesh Thokala,"Great game,no ads, this is the best game of my life when I played for a year I'm a 1 to 2 year veteran since when I played this for the first time the games were sooo good! Please make better graphics and fix the camera bug while missclick but it's still to say how amazing this game is I hope better updates occur"
960,961,2022-06-04,2022,06,04,5,Iznee H,"I like this game. I almost have 100 friends. The Hating issues is not good directions By frezzing (Mobile) And the Crash part, using mobile make a lot of glitches and, this game is a Online Game, PC/Laptop is way more helpful cause theres just a little bit of glitches. (100% Crash Part: Screen Freezed. Back Home with no Touching Home Button. Screen Blur And Freeze. Seperate Directions. Signal make moving slower and juming slower. (Mobile Issues)"
961,962,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,1,amandahaley1994,"The avatar customization has several glitches. Classic clothing only shows a few of what you have, and regardless of how long I wait no more show up. Going through my accessories will sometimes result in a glitch of nothing showing up at all. The desktop/PC site has the option of ""advanced settings"" for accessories while mobile does not. Going through anything on the app(groups, inventory, chat, shop, etc.) is laggy."
962,963,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,3,Lotus leaf,"The games in here are perfect, the community varies, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, but my main problem. Is I can't sit in even a non-laggy game for 3 minutes before I'm sent back to the Roblox menu on mobile. Y'all have gotta fix it for phone/mobile players because it happens EVERY, SINGLE TIME. And it sucks because it never happens when I play on my computer, it's only the phone"
963,964,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Mattie Paul,"Great game. I just have 1 main problem. Any time I try to say something in game, they put tags. Roblox if you're reading this, please fix this issue. I know most of it is to prevent bullying but you've gone too far, making it to where we cannot say anything. Besides that, amazing game. I play it about everyday! You creators are amazing!"
964,965,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,3,Rinkal karia,It is very nice but there is a date given and after that date comes it says to upgrade till the upgrade is not over we can't play games also the buttons are not comfortable and some games are very easy and when we turn it on sometimes it gets shorter or higher and sometimes it doesn't turn on
965,966,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,A Google user,"I love roblox because you can play with your friends and you have a variety of different games to play. My favourite game is adopt me I like adopt me because you can level up your pets,adopt a child and you can go to the sky castle and buy potions you can also bungee jump from the top I also like how the balloon ride is so cheep it is only 5 bucks."
966,967,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,kayla downing,I love this game especially Brookhaven it has new updates and when it's like different seasons like Halloween or Easter it changes its setup and you can have all these cool things and they upgrade it a few months ago I think and now you can have your own apartment you have a coffee shop now you have a dentist there's so many new things love how it does upgrades every year
967,968,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,2,cami,"I love this game. Ive been playing sInce 2018 and have bought many robux purchases. The game is really fun having avatar options, making friends and playing many high developed games. There are many problems with games, but this is a MULTI-mil dollar company. They still have bypasses used since way before 2018 that still work. There are also Innapropoate stuff thats way too bad for a kids game. Although this is 10+ there are still very young people playing. I recommend to fix your moderating."
968,969,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Joshwa Richard,"Roblox ROCKS! but the issue that really makes me mad is that there is no menu button for options to leave the game. 😒 I had to exit and reopen roblox. Can you please fix this bug, I will rate this 5 stars. Edit: thanks for updating this game, I could even finally hide the chat menu and stuff like that, access to settings of the gameplay. Thanks alot"
969,970,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Jamie Buzuvis,it's been getting better. After a little bit of research and I understand why some things are how they are. I Now understand that the code is very old and that you can't change it without breaking the entire site. now this is just me but I know some people rely on Roblox to make money. but I honestly wouldn't care if it took you like a week to fix the code without Roblox. I don't fully understand. but there isn't much problems. I would like a bug fix for mobile because there are alot of bugthere
970,971,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,anis soffiya,"!!ROBLOX PLEASE READ THIS!! ‌WHY AM I JUST GIVING 3 ⭐? At first I'm very like the graphics but not the system. It's very slow, always loading. Even after I update the game, it's still the same.. so what is the function of my upgrade? My internet and storage? LOL. I'm gonna deleted the game if it's still like this. (NO JOKE) I hate this so much, just waste my internet connection.. even roblox say ""Your Internet Connection Is Error"" but the fact that Roblox system are lazy."
971,972,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Monique McClinton,"I give this a 5 star because this game is just unbelievably wonderful. I've had this game since I was 7-8. I'm 10 now, which means I've had the same account for 2-3 years now, and there has only been one mistake, that was my fault. So this game is wonderful in every way possible. And it's ALWAYS there for you when your sad, mad etc. Ever since I downloaded this game, I haven't regretted it ONCE. So what I'm saying is, you should download this game ASAP because it's just amazing. Good job Roblox!"
972,973,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,4,Canada Ball,"Very good game. This game is very fun to explore and meet new friends, but there is one flaw i'd like to address: Lag. As someone on a chrome book, it lags for me everytime I log in or play a certain game. Sometimes the keys don't even work even if they were meant to."
973,974,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Jennifer Clark,"I love this game its fun to play with people, but my only problem with it is that it's been kicking me off while I am in the middle of a roleplay or having a chat with a friend, and most of the time I try to join back and the server Is full, today just a minute ago, I was almost done with something i was typying and it just kicked me off and said no connection when it said my wifi was great. Over all I think this is a great game since if someone is doing anything to you, you can report them."
974,975,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,wenis benispenis,This game is a really fun game with loads of games inside it to play and explore in. You can chat with friends and play really fun games with them. My only problem is that it keeps kicking me out of games saying someone else is on my account when i know there isn't and the games always break where can't use tools in games and i am unable to use the chat.
975,976,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,3,Christian Benites,"The Game Is So Fun!! I love the game alot but there are some cons to the mobile app. Specific games you join it lags because the game is loading, which is understandable, but after it loads i move at 1001 frames per second. Then it restarts the app and sometimes i cant even get back into the app and i have to reload the app."
976,977,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,5,Ava Marie,"It is THE BEST game ever. When I started playing, I was obsessed. There were so many games in the app, and I just started playing them all. There's so many genres, like roleplaying and obbies (obstacle courses) and tycoons and even fighting games. There's silly games and free admin games. It's so much fun and I really recommend it, so you should start playing now!"
977,978,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Brooklyn Zamora,I really like the game it has like every single game you would ever want if it let's you get in because some games if you are playing on tablet you can't get in because it's for computer only but you can also make your own games so that's pretty fun too thats just for you there is also farm world there is would you rather shard Seeker cook burgers work at a pizza place 2 player tycoons and tons of more games to play one last tip before I'm done you can customize your avatar out of space oof
978,979,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,4,Jenee,"Great but I can't save a character. It doesn't appear in saved. Also, in some games, my character's hair and outer outfit disappears(my character's the anime type) which makes it bald. Sometimes it's also laggy and often makes my character die. But overall, it's a great game."
979,980,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Taylor Maya Thomas,"It is very nice you can do anything in here like it's worth it to buy some robux yeah like it is so nice but there are some bugs like first one sometimes when i leave the game and open it again but then i need to leave it and rejoin so pls fix this,robux prices are really worth it like you can make friends and do anything you want! That's why I give it 5 star rating"
980,981,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Kim Tea,"Great game! I love playing it with my friends. But I have 2 problems which are 1. Sometimes when I try to rotate my camera, it just zooms instead. 2. If you can add a way to earn robux, can you do like my opinion? There should be a bar in the account info and if you earn badges the bar will go up so if you have 5 badges on the bar, you can exchange them for robux so that means 5 badges = 5 robux. So if the devs could fix and add these it would be PERFECT! That's all I can say about this game"
981,982,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,2,okay sure,My only complaint is of the camera issues I experience like sometimes the joystick becomes the camera and sometimes I cand move my camera at all or i can only zoom in and out and I play a lot of tycoons for long periods of times a lot and it gets to be to much please fix it also my chat sometimes dosent work either and sometimes I can't move at all please fix your game
982,983,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Delilah Pond,ITS SO FUN!!! There are so many fun games somtimes it will kick you and is somtimes lagy but that's mainly do to your internet. it's so cool all the different games you can choose from is so awsome I play it everyday for a little bit . THIS GAME IS THE BEST ALSO YOU CAN ADD YOUR FRIENDS. You can also make new friend ships that will keep you entertained.
983,984,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,1,Öykü ÖZDEMİR,"This app makes bugs, also in my device. I'm using a Samsung which is mobile, but it glitches or bugs Club Roblox when I am doing a hospital in the Cottage building. It always makes me swipe left or right and also not swipe the things left or right. I am so disappointed in these bugs, please fix them and I will give it a 5star and write something about the game being good or being very unbuggy. If actually fixing, it will get more ratings from me ofcourse. When it suddenly gets fixed. It's good!"
984,985,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Melanie Woodall,"Roblox is a very fun game, had it for years. I love all the different type of games and things you can do! There is one thing that I don't like (Which is very minor). There arent any good free things on roblox. Most of the free robux items are old. I hope in the future we can have better quality free roblox items that don't just come from events or games! Overall really good game! Would reccomend wouldn't delete!"
985,986,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Ally Mcgee,Best game ever seen five stars my favorite game full-time nothing's taking it spot and also my favorite games are Brookhaven cube defense loot quest and random rumble edit: I actually take it back on writing it a five star because there are some glitches that make me have to leave and rejoin and I don't like to updates because they're just so annoying
986,987,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Megan Stratton,"perfect. Edit: Amazing game however I have a few problems, when I play a game sometimes it either lags, freezes, or locks the screen so I can only zoom in or out. I see this is an issue for other people to and I just please ask that you would fix that, but otherwise great game."
987,988,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,AdhaMMZ,"This game is the best online game I've ever played in my life. 5/5 . A great game. You can change your password, character and graphic. Also you can play with your friends, and the control is the best. Play this game on MAC, iPad, mobile, IOS, window and so muh more. Download this game right now! New one - bro why Roblox deleted the oof sound"
988,989,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,4,Angel Martinez,"Roblox definitely is fun, and I always play with my friends. There are some issues with Roblox however, especially the framerate and crashing issues. If you don't have a very good phone, then you can forget about playing big games like Arsenal, Legends of Speed, and Adopt Me at a good framerate. There's always lag, and it usually crashes sometimes whenever I'm playing a big game. Its fun, but they could definitely try to improve their framerate and gameplay."
989,990,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,2,Trevor F,When i open the app it just shows a white screen so i had to reopen it several times and it was still showing a white screen. Then I opened roblox the next day and it was STILL showing a white screen. I would give roblox a 5 star rating as I've played roblox on PC and I had no trouble with the platform. But please do fix this problem as this could be occuring to other players.
990,991,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,5,Savannah Guerrero,"Great app. Love using and trying out all the different kinds of games and obbies. Very fun and time-consuming. One thing I would like to fix, is the fact that it costs Robux to make your own club. I do not have Robux. Otherwise, beautiful app with good gameplay. Two thumbs up! 👍👍 (Graphics could use improvement)"
991,992,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Rachelle Clarke,Sooo its great and all and yes ill give it five stars only because some of the games have amazing graphics so ya but i would like you to fix some bugs like: When i press play it somtimes wont let me or just boots me out of the game...and thats the only thing i have trouble with really...(not sure if you fixed this bug...) but apart from that really cool
992,993,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,KELLY ROBERTS,Good variety of games. Only complaint is when you join a timed game and either spawn right in front of the enemy or join when there's less then a minute to play. Very frustrating
993,994,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,2,Jose Daniel Limjuco,"Hi, This roblox game is cool and i rlly enjoy it.. But one problem i reset my characher bc i fell but when i try to controll the controller it annoys me bc it was moving when i move the controller up,down,left,right when im walking and move the screen it zooming in and out pleaze fix this thank you.."
994,995,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Lisa Gehringer,Roblox is a really good game but... There are a few bugs🐞. If you put at least 3 fingers on the screen then you'll be forced to zoom in and out instead of moving your screen around
995,996,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,3,Maddie Porter,This game is great and all but I don't understand who some of my clothes were taken away it's pretty hard for me to be able to get robux bc my dad won't let me but if he is in a good mood which is really rare. Anyways my point is you need to fix your game with disconnecting people when their internet is perfectly fine or kicking people out so this game is a 3 star for me.
996,997,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,4,Ivor Chiu,"Good game. In pc its easy but in mobile its hard, why? The jump button is so small that sometimes when you try to press it you cant jump. And the screen moves all the time I move. Please give an option that you can adjust the size of the jump button. I have no problems with it in pc but in mobile its kinda hard to move."
997,998,2022-07-04,2022,07,04,4,Kelley Mackenroth,"It is really fun, but has a lot of scamming sometimes. Sometimes, if you are on a laptop, the mouse can be EXTREMELY glitchy or it wont go to the place you want it to. I have had Roblox for about a year. The most annoying problem is when you open the app and it automatically closes. Overalll, I thinks its a great, entertaining, game! And when your acount gets deleleted it's not fun."
998,999,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,4,Julia Grisanti,"I love Roblox in all its existance, but let's get one thing straight; Lag. We all expeirence lag, especially if you play on a ""Not intended for gaming"" type of device, other than that, I have one too many games to play! And Also I play on a Chromebook and if I were to rate the lag, the stakes would be low. And the app looks like I'm playing on mobile. Edit: I need to delete it on this device cuz of the lag, but i have it on other devices."
999,1000,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,4,Delphie Staton,"The game is great its just on some games you can't play or its really laggy. So I gave it 4 stars. overall the games are great and you can add your friends and play with them, and it's really fun. But you also have to update it over and over again but it doesn't really take that long.sometimes there is games that you can play and cannot, like if you type any game in the search button and you click on the game then it will probably not be good."
1000,1001,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Nick Vuckovich,"Roblox is a good app, really, it's awesome, sometimes it will shut down or glitch, and it's annoying, but other than that it's fine. And there is really annoying people there, or just weird and odd people, but it's not really Roblox's fault that they are on there. So don't blame them for the people there. Just saying, try to spread positivity. :)"
1001,1002,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,4,Dane Lagu,"Great game massive game for many games to chose on and it's really easy to use! Maybe make some changes because sometimes when I move my joystick it also moves my camera and sometimes when I am on a game and then I chat the exit the chat it zooms in my camera sometimes I can fix it sometimes not, so can you fix those both please great game to play with and is multiplayer so thank you for making this game and making it multiplayer! Hope this review helps because maybetheyexperience(other player)"
1002,1003,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Troy H,I honestly love this app there's a bunch of cool games to do on it. The real purpose is just to have fun edit: I reduced this to 3 stars because the moderation just sucks and you can't even say numbers also the slenders and copy and pastes ruin it. 2nd edit:Roblox is kind back together again so im gonna give it 4 stars but its not like it used to be :(
1003,1004,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Vyktorea Hayes,I LOVE this game! It has so many fun minigames on it. The only thing you need to fix is the disconnection all the time. I was playing Survive The Killers and i was alive for about 7000 seconds and i got disconnected for being gone for 20 minutes and i lost all of my progress.
1004,1005,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,4,S7M33R11 Jjanes,"Its a really fun game but a lot of bugs. 1-sometimes ur screen cant turn around. 2-when i swipe my screen it zoom in & out 3-my phone freezes for 10 seconds then, when i start moving it will shake so much. Its not a phone problem! Its the game. I have seen many people experiencing this. Please fix those bugs! Thank you."
1005,1006,2022-08-23,2022,08,23,4,Gopal Sanghadia,The game is good. Its graphics are also perfect. I never feel like its lagging. It is smooth enough for a gamer. Really one should try it. I insist to all the readers to download this game. Its really awesome 👌 👌 👌
1006,1007,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,1,Ayesha Reine M.,"Its a really fun game but when i play da hood my ipad lags and it take me back on the roblox logo and i have to clear it just for me to play again,please fix this glitch i hope it wont happen again, it got even more worse. When i join a game i cannot zoom in, and if i try to zoom out or in, it makes the screen move left to right"
1007,1008,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,TGXFlamezZZ,"ROBLOX is honestly a good website for games and you can find just about any type of game to play and its really fun. ... EDIT: ah yes. a year later. this game banned me and now I don't like it as much. 3 stars since the game is kinda fun. EDIT: ok I change my mind, another year later and this game is probably still one of my favorite games of all time."
1008,1009,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,3,Jcoax,"I honestly love the game but there are some problems with the controls. I am on mobile and sometimes when i open up the main menu and scroll down, the joystick gets weird and my camera follows the the way I move my joystick. This stops when i use the classic mode joystick but some movements mode are set by the developer and i have to rejoin. There is also another bug where my camera glitches out and I cant turn my camera to any direction, I just zoom in and out of my character if I do."
1009,1010,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,3,Hanny Banany,"This app can be great to cure your boredom. But let's be real it isn't always that great! Most the time you only find a few games fun and only find games fun for a short period of time ""that's my view though"". Though it's a great app I've had some pretty annoying experiences with it. For example: I've been hacked more then once I know that's not there fault but they never tried to help with it. Also logged out my account more then once. And plenty more things! So is it worth it?"
1010,1011,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Carrie Spencer,This game is really fun!!! But sometimes when I join a game it does it portrait mode and I'm not holding my phone like that but sometimes it doesn't do that And it's getting very annoying.I don't know if it's my phone or the game or the app .if it is please fix it that's all I have to say. Overall it's a really great game! Also if a another game gets hacked just clear out on your phone! (Still fix that too) And sometimes meepcity glitches. I teleport to someone and the buttons disappears.fix it
1011,1012,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Jake Doyle,It got a lot's of games you can play in this game and no adds to find in ROBLOX !!!😀😀😀 But I do have some suggestions to add to the game 1)make it you can comet on a game 2) add saves to the game so if you want to continue a game 3)make stuff a fit cheaper
1012,1013,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Almera Ogbeifun,I love it but there are some faults this game is awesome but once you start a world and you have connection problems even for 2 seconds when the connection is back it will automatically go back to home and it happens mostly when you are enjoying 😉 the game 🎮
1013,1014,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,DaWeeb,"Roblox is one of the apps I mostly play. I really enjoy playing the game. Only there is one little annoying problem. When I join games in roblox, I cant move the screen, like turn the screen to see the front of my avatar. Everytime i tur the screen, my avatar moves along with the screen....I dont have any other problems in roblox...Roblox is a really great app for kids/teens."
1014,1015,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Dragon Fighter,It's a FANTASTIC app but it is loaded with people who are trying to scam you (especially in adopt me) and people have started online dating through this app. Other than that I have nothing negative towards this game and it is a great way for friends to meet up and play together and I definitely recommend this app.
1015,1016,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Rob Ghanem,"The game is amazing! I really enjoy playing it, there is so many game u can play like: Adopt me, brookhaven, livetopia and many more! U can even meet so many people! Love it, tho the is something creepy in the roblox catalog, when I was editing my avater I saw a hand it was really hard to ee cause it was black, the hand was black and it was with long fingers, please tell me what is that..."
1016,1017,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Zandy youtube,"It is an amazing app but since I'm always outside I can never really play it all to often, I think if there was like an offline mode which let you play outside but it disabled a few features it would be really nice."
1017,1018,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,2,Nyla Crawford,The game has got worst. I regret my last rating. You should really get rid of the slender avatars. Also the new update on the clothes is HORRIBLE you should really delete the new clothes and some of the old clothes as well because this is a game that is supposed to be for kids. And instead of blocking people you should just kick them out of the game for good because as soon as they come back they do the same stuff over and over again. I liked the old roblox better and I'm sure everyone else did.
1018,1019,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,jhaii reyes,"the game is perfect. I've played this for years know, although the update.. well not really a fan. i still love it! but idk why i Can't login in my main acc. I've changed the password in ""forgot the password or nickname"" button. But still it Won't open, this has been happening for like days know. I've spent my Money on That acc. please idk if it's a bug or smth, i just want my acc back. Thankyou!"
1019,1020,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,2,h,"Stop forcing me to update your stupid, boring, and corrupt app almost every other week. I play on computer mainly but I still want the app on my phone but I can't open it without updating it, and updating it takes storage. My internal storage only allows up to 15 gigabytes and your GARGANTUAN app (currently near 600 MB) WILL NOT let me move it to my SD card. I've moved all I could to my SD card and I FINALLY can update your app on my phone just so it can be even laggier. Powering imagination!!!!"
1020,1021,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,4,Colm Starrs,It's a great game but there is two problems. One the camera glitch. It's so annoying the only way to solve the problem is to leave Roblox then rejoin. Two when I leave adopt me the screen freezes completely and I try to swipe down in the game but it won't let me. Please fix this bug.
1021,1022,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,5,Angelic Tune,"Best game I'll probably ever experience/play , I love how theres so many options to pick from like rpgs or grinding/level games. I have only had good experiences from this game though I think they could chill a bit on what they block (for example, you cant say numbers like ""one"") without it tagging it.. it does get pretty annoying but besides that, overall its a really great game. I dont recommend it for younger children but it's definitely fun"
1022,1023,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,megan lavelle,"4 stars i would give it but the one thing that makes me put a 4 is because it can be really laggy and disconect you out of your game but other than that it is an amazing game i would definatley recommend it for little kids it is so fun to play with friends cousions and people you dont see as much i do really like it , it is a really good game try it now. WARNING REALLY LAGGY"
1023,1024,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,John Kim,"I really like that you don't need anything to enter a game but I kinda don't like the slow internet which makes the game really slow. And you always have to beg to your parents for the robux. Also, if I accidentally click on the ""show multi screen"" button, my screen always goes to the bottom of character if I attempt to go forward"
1024,1025,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Nilla Wiggs,"There needs to be a better system for discovering new games. All of the sponsored and popular games seem to appeal to young children. Finding something with a more mature player base is hard to accomplish. Otherwise, it's without a doubt, the best free game out there."
1025,1026,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,3,jayden.27 .11.09,This is a great app and its very amusing. I play it alot but recently i have been unable to play it. Everytime i open roblox my phone immediately becomes hot to the touch and sometimes even burns me. I have a pretty recent phone only 2-3 years old and this does not happen on any other games. Please fix this roblox as i know many others that have had the same experience as me. Thank you
1026,1027,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,3,Nathan shorts,Roblox is definitely one if my most favorite games. There is a bunch of people and places that you can meet and go to and it's fun to explore and make freinds but.. you'll have to sacrifice all the storage on your device for it. If in any way this could be fixed please do so.
1027,1028,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Itz_Gacha_ Pastel Official backup,"I love roblox A LOT! But, ever since the game crashed for a few days days mobile has had A LOT of problems. Like this new bug where if it's too laggy then the game freezes (it's easily fixable though) and there's this other bug, where you move your screen and accidentally click the roblox logo on the top then you won't be able to move your screen or only be able to zoom in & out. There's also when ur walking and you also click the rblx logo (just switch to classic thumbstick) hopefully you fix.."
1028,1029,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,3,Jennifer Andrews,"I have a couple complaints. For starters everytime I try to play Mall Tycoon, the app crashes. I have noticed bugs in it as well. Like everytime when you choose the cellphone option, the mall loads like bits and pieces. Whenever you think your good, the app lags and sends you to a launching experience screen that does not work. Secondly everytime I try to log in it crashes. The lag, the app crashing, the app taking you to a launching experience screen is ridiculous. Fix this please?"
1029,1030,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,karina garcia,"So, I love roblox and how you can make friends with people around the world i would pretty much recommend downloading this game but there a bit of bugs that do need working on, they still haven't mainly fixed the issue where you try and turn around but you can only see the back not the front. Other than that everything is great."
1030,1031,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Ira NanaRay,"Very fun game you can explore a lot here in this app, I've been playing this game for 3 years straight! The bug fixes are awesome, however, there's a lot of games created by a global community, it's very fun, and you can change your avatar and be anything you like, i really recommend this game/app 😊♥️"
1031,1032,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,3,Kristine Chloie Martinez,"Roblox is fine, Yes it should be cool but thats your opinion. as a mobile phone user I can't have ""unlimited"" storage like the people on PC or Laptop. And there is WAY too many updates even though they aren't that useful. Just new designs or shapes when you open the app. So I suggest that Roblox shouldn't have too many updates if it's not that major. Thx for reading"
1032,1033,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Madison Venker,"I love this game but there is a few issues. 1) too many updates, 2) everytime I try to update it I have to do it atleast 3 times until it works. It says something like you cant download this app. 3) some games are weird and you have to have your phone up and down instead of side to side and you can still play it but its difficult to do. Other than that it's great! But please fix these things so more people can enjoy it!"
1033,1034,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,2,Naomi Anderson,I gave you a two and was tempted to give a one is because when ever I play a game in the middle of the game it will leave the game and put me on a screen that says launching experience but it never loads and I sit there and I wait and then I have to exit the app and this has happened not once not twice no every game I go to this has happenes and I'm kind of getting mad and I've updated it and nothing seems to work please fix this >:|
1034,1035,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,2,Jaznie Faith San Juan,"Its good but based on my recent experiences the game is frequently lagging especially on mobile, there were instances where my screen would freeze and I have no choice but to leave the game, I also have to deal with the app suddenly closing and I have to restart it please do something about it thank you."
1035,1036,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,3,Bekah Currier,"Okay, it is super fun, but it is always needing updates! Updating sometimes is making me delete some of my other apps! Which is annoying! Because some apps I have spent alot of money on! Also, I have just started experiencing glitches even when I have full internet! I hope you can try to fix this!? Thanks!👍"
1036,1037,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,5,endless lists,"Amazing game! Super underrated. You can do nearly anything in roblox. There are so many different games to play and you can even play with friends! You can customise your avatar and buy stuff ingame with robux but the reason it's only 4 stars is because you can only obtain robux with real currency. If there was a way to get robux by playing that would be amazing but I guess that will never happen. Other than that, best game ever :)"
1037,1038,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,2,tiny savage,"The game is fun and all but like the only problem for me is that when I try to buy robux it keeps on saying ""please set up Google play to make any purchases"" which leaves me concerned because this has never happened but it's getting annoying. I have watched so many videos on how to fix this problem and I have tried everything and it still wont let me make any purchases which is actually annoying."
1038,1039,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,A Google user,"Good game, but sometimes laggy. Plus why replace the oof sound with a moan 😭. Like u could use a death sound weird get it u got copywrited and prob sued but still, I hope you fix this in the future. That's why I've gave it 3 stars if it wasn't for the ""oof"" sound and the lag it would be 5! Hope you fix this. Bye (Also warning for new players: if recommend u get 2-step verification and link ur email to roblox to prevent hacking as a lot of hacking goes around aswell)"
1039,1040,2022-07-21,2022,07,21,3,Charisma Ramirez,It's good. But for some reason I can't play any games due to the Launching experience glitch. I would change my review if you fix the glitch Edit: Its like been a month and Roblox still didn't fix this. I have also found new bugs It sometimes freezes the game like I can't move Sometimes when I'm moving it won't make me stop walking/jumping then it will make me have control again I'm going to rate it 2 stars now Please fix this glitch
1040,1041,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,5,Nelly Chosa,"I think this game is amazing and fun. There are so many things to do, but one bug is that when I went to certain games I could play for a minute then my screen would go black but i could still hear the music from the game, I would have to wait for 20 minutes to get it to work again. I this bug could be fix I would be thankful. But overall it is a fun game to play."
1041,1042,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Vilte Andriukaityte,It's really fun BC you can add new friends online you can save passwords if you are forgetful!It would be better if robux was less cheaper because somepoeple can't even afford 80 robux! So it would be nice if it was cheaper and more sales would probably go faster.
1042,1043,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,5,A Google user,"My experience in Roblox has been brilliant! I've been playing for 3 years and I'm pretty sure I never quitted it for a while. This game is definitely a recommendation for people who love making friends and just to enjoy fun! Many games have great graphics and there are so many ones to choose from! From baking games to roleplays and story games, surely you will love this!"
1043,1044,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,MateoPlaysRoblox,"It's a good game and all! But why 4 stars you may ask? Well sometimes when i join a game for some reason the shiftlock is own and it annoys me since the games i play don't have shiftlock so i'm having to play a shiftlock game ans turn on and off the shiftlock button refresh the roblox page and as i go back in the game it's back to normal! Another bug i came upon on was a bug that made me whole grey the hair, the clothing etc i'm hoping for this to be fixed veet soon in the next update!"
1044,1045,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,BunnyClan YT,"Good app in general, good platform, but some experiences on roblox are bypassing the filter for example crosswoods, so it is not the most reliable to keep your account safe, since that was an issue since 2016, also connection is great"
1045,1046,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,4,Maggie Valle,Great Game! And there's a few things I want fixed sometimes in this game when you go to the menu to leave the experience accidently when you try to move your view of the game it zooms in and out and the only way to fix it is to rejoin so I would like that fixed otherwise it's a great game!
1046,1047,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,A Google user,"I love this game I play all the time I just think it's such a cool game cuz you could play so many games inside of the game and there are no ads, it is so fun if I were you I would get this game. My favorite games in Roblox is theme Park tycoon 2, and my restaurant. That's all, hopes of you getting it and enjoying it."
1047,1048,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,Ginger Green,"This is an overall, great game. Very easy concept and it keeps me occupied for hours on end. But, I usually play on my PC and it's a dream. But I like to play on my phone aswell. I don't know if it's just my phone, but it seems that roblox lags quite a lot more on a mobile device than on a PC. I would either like this fixed,or checked to make sure it's not just me,lol! But everything else is great and fun so keep up the good work!"
1048,1049,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,3,Vincent Bebis,"The game is there but it lacks optimization, controls aren't customizable and the touch controls are buggy. These were the same issues since like 2 years ago."
1049,1050,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,4,Norhisam Naziri,Wow I must say this game is the most coolest game I have play in my entire life and. Hope u don't mind me say the thing that annoyed me. Well the thing is that my jump button always lag and sometimes I couldn't move my screen and because of that I have to rejoin tha game and it is annoying when you were playing some parkor or some racing game. Hope u fix it.
1050,1051,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,4,Marissa Samuel,"Best game iv ever played! I love all the games these creates have created!! But why give it a 4 then? Because sometimes when I'm playing my screen will zoom in and out when I try looking somwhere sometimes while playing games and the 2nd thing is that sometimes my screen will lock while I'm playing roleplay games and it makes it to the point where I can't see my character from the front!! Please fix it, take ur time! But over all it is the best game iv played so far!😁"
1051,1052,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,2,Noemi Orozco,"Good, but tons of bugs, and the internet sucks if I'm playing during a call. It took me more than 20 minutes yesterday loading into the game, but before it did, it kicked me out because I was in the waiting/loading room for more than 20 minutes. 2 stars cause of this."
1052,1053,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,Yuki - Yukishima,"I like this app but theres a few bugs and things that annoy me like when i try saving one ov my avatars in the creations it wont let me like it will but not for a girl avatar. There is this glich that happend when i like move, not much this happens sometimes it like zooms in and out reapetedly, If you guys were to fix this it would be great !"
1053,1054,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Bexley Cerise,"Love the game but I only have 4 problems 1: Sometimes it lags even if you literally update the app 2: robux-like is it a must to buy robux instead on events just allow players to play a specific game and get robux according to their points? I literally had to spend soo much money for robux 3: updates-like anytime I have to update to play I have to delete some apps cause of the mb and it takes alot of space 4: Like @ Dennis said, there is this glitch where you can't move the screen. Plz fix that"
1054,1055,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Shelbey L,"I love this game, but it could use more updates. First off, I keep lagging and it glitches, second I want it to be on offline game so I can play offline. But this game is great and has hundreds of games to play. I recommend downloading this game. It is fun and you can make up to 200 friends!"
1055,1056,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,4,Alaire Joachim Lomugdang,"Bad many glitches. You randomly get disconnected for no reason at all even though you have a stable connection next the camera can glitch or malfunction like the camera follows your joystick when trying to move it, or when you move your camera instead changing it's location it just zooms in (only happens when you press the screen with multiple fingers at the same time), and just doesn't move at all. if you have the money just buy a laptop or a computer since they barely have any glitches."
1056,1057,2022-07-03,2022,07,03,3,Jude AH,"This game is great. But there's a very annoying actual problem with it on mobile.. The camera glitches 85% of the time when I join a game, it just glitches to the point I can barely play the game and I've dealt with this problem for so long (probably a year or more) Please fix it."
1057,1058,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,3,yourallsus,"Its really fun and all but theres a bug that everyones screen does not move, and another screen bug that makes our screen zoom in, and nowadays they have been complaining that its so laggy, and about the screen and bugs, please fix it if you can!"
1058,1059,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,5,Lolah Sproul,"It's amazing, but I think there should be a somewhat complicated tutorial on how to draw and animate stuff in the place where ya make games. But otherwise, it's still really awesome to play! Edit: I wish you could play with users who are offline."
1059,1060,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,5,Cozy,"It is the BEST game I ever played. I downloaded it on my ipad, and my computer, and it is the best experience ever. It doesn't crash your device, and it has NO ads and play free app. You can buy Robux, which helps you with many things, and play with your friends and family. Everybody plays it, so you should play too. It has many different games inside, and AMAZING."
1060,1061,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Maria Long,"It's really fun and entertaining 😄 it's an fun online experience that allows you to make new friends have friends on there and play with them and talk with them whenever you want, it also has millions of games inside of the game, however, be careful for scammers, hackers, and sometimes even people that can hack into your information, find out where you live, how old you are, and other dangerous stuff like that, so be careful of who you trust. I totally recommend this game. 👌"
1061,1062,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Ahmed Samy,It's a good app but there are some issues if your using a phone or a tablet/Ipad firstly sometimes when I try to look around the screen just zooms in and out. Second when try to move forward the screen looks up and last thing sometimes I can't look around. Please fix these issues
1062,1063,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,4,Josie Johns,"This game is every single game in one game!!! its so fun but i haven't had an update in a long time for some reason but this game has trends, topic's, aesthetics in all, it has fighting games, tycoons, simulators, animals, superheros, villains, etc but i love the updates on the games sometimes when you say certain names, numbers, or colors it'll tag and say this: ###### sometimes the game is really laggy and i think people should start putting Trigger warnings on some games but its great!"
1063,1064,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,3,Joe Hansie,"I've played roblox on PC and on mobile. However, on chromebook it's very buggy. Broken features on multiple games, the mouse not locking in place, not having access to PC exclusive roblox games despite being on a PC, and images or text on groups bugging and creating colored lines across the screen. I'd love if there was a roblox for chromebook app specifically, but I doubt that'll happen. It's still playable and fun, but a lot less dependable."
1064,1065,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Blain adventures,"Roblox is great game, yet there are some flaws. The game freezes occasionally and the lag can be little to big time. But above all, it is a good game. Really recommend downloading it."
1065,1066,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Libby Hill,4/5 it is very laggy and robuc can be over priced as well as the fact you don't even start with anything is annoying too. There's a wide variety of Games to play 🙂 and also the no robux things aren't good at all compared to the robux items and the hairs sometimes don't fit and the faces are quite bad. I know you need money to keep working it and all but 5 star if the items in the free section were better🤗😊❤️ also quite a lot of online daters but other than those things its a really good game!
1066,1067,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Mako Eyveit,"Great game, it just lags a bit. Although I do have to complain about the bugged games and moderation. Roblox should really fix that because safechat bans numbers for children (but I do understand why) while you can find a thong in the catalog. I also wish Chromebook was a PC device instead of mobile device. The avatar is great though, you have so many options and the game has a lot of diversity to it."
1067,1068,2022-06-17,2022,06,17,4,Rebecca Richards,"When I first started playing it was really interseting and fun. I thought it was easy to develope on how to play, and even without robux you can still have much fun with friends. There are some bugs in the process and scammers, but other than that it truly is an amazing game for kids and adults."
1068,1069,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Lin Lumabao,"The game is really fun, but I hate when you accidentally clicked the Roblox icon while walking. It glitches your screen and when you move your thumbstick, your screen moves. I also hate this one big where you can't add friend requests. Please fix this Roblox asap. Thank you!"
1069,1070,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Cora Frank,"I've been playing roblox since 2016 and it's great! I absolutely love the high number of choices and game to play. It's hard to get bored. However, it's different than I remember. Old games I used to play either got taken down or no others play them anymore, but it's still pretty fun."
1070,1071,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,4,speeder the hedgehog,"A pretty good game but i have a few problems, 1. Its laggy on mobile, 2. It sometimes goes in and out with the camera and not left and right 3. Sometimes the joystick moves the camera and this makes games unplayable 4. Instead of adding promotional brands, fix the lag of mobile players, i play regularly so i have had these glitches, please fix this app or you will keep losing players, thank you in advance roblox team!"
1071,1072,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,Aubree Leigh,It is a nice game but I really wish you can just have robux not having to pay for it. Another thing is some games you can't play cause you need a newer device. But I do like you can play with friends and family ☺️ And there is so many games you can choose from! But some games are very laggy. Another thing is some games they dont save your progress it is very annoying cause what if you were like you had one more floor to go and you left and came back the next day and all you progress went away!!!
1072,1073,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,5,Chloe Purser,"its really good! acceptable for kids of all ages. lots of different games for you too explore, you can role-play, build or even climb into a world of adventures! If you were too ask me id definatekly say yes too downloading it. ive been playing this game for 2 years now and it hasnt let me down, not once!"
1073,1074,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,4,Mark Go,I like this game the most but there is some problems 1. sometimes when I join pet simulator X it doesn't let me join. 2. The rotation screen just only have big small all over again 3. When I pressed the jump button for too long it will infinitely jump until I need to leave and join back. If you fix these problems I will give this game a five star 🌟.
1074,1075,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Emilie Owen,This is a really great game. There are many experiences and genres so suitable for everyone. You can make friends roleplay etc. You can also create your own game. You can play roblox with friends and create private servers (sometimes with robux) for just you. You are able to log into many devices. I definitely recommend this
1075,1076,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,3,Sandra B,I realy love this game but there are a few bugs. 1. It dosen't let me play some of my favourite games. 2. I want to play the game but it keeps leaving the game without me presing leave. 3. When I play a game is dosen't roatate. 4. When i move it rotates mt screen angle down to my charecters feet. And thats all the bugs please fix them. 👋bye

1077,1078,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,3,Chloe Ann,"The game is pretty fun I would say, there's a lot to explore bcs there's many games out there. Although your moderation is pretty bad bcs my account got banned for 1 day MANY times even tho I don't talk to chat that much and I don't do anything bad that can break the rules- I always try to be family friendly all the time and I don't want my account to be terminated bcs I bought a lot of robux there- so pls fix it. I also do not like the updates that much, the old Roblox was honestly better so."
1078,1079,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,5,Carl Gorsuch,I love the experience it can be a little lagy at times but if you have a good internet connection you shouldn't have to worry about that. Another thing I love about it is that there is a massive selection of games in the games that range from tycoons to roleplay. There is also a lot of options available for clothing and accessories for your character. I just wish that there was a way to get free robux in the game from watching adds or something but there are a lot of updates I love this game.
1079,1080,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,5,ILoveHorses 2007,"This game is very fun, many different games to choose from. Suitible for pretty much all ages. Its cool you can play with anybody. Its not so hard to understand how to play. Easy for kids or anyone to easily make friends and play the games together. Very cool and simple. I give 5 stars because its never acting wrong. There were a couple of times when it would kick me off but that wasnt Roblox's fault. I love how I can just log on and play, there isnt anything extra needed to play. Thanks for it!"
1080,1081,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Diamond Pizza,"If you ever have a problem where your screen zooms in and zooms out, we'll only thing u have to do is leave and come back or if you don't fell like doing that then hold your screen with 2 fingers and walk, but u can't turn around and this works on my android tablet and might work on whatever u have but some games instead of leaving and coming back u have to leave roblox and come back. HAVE A PERFECT ROBLOX EXPERIENCE!!"
1081,1082,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,5,Jackie Garwood,I love this game so much. Its the best game ever. Except the only downside is that if you play a game for to long it lags and kicks you out eg: on my other account I can't play RH( royal high) and I really like it and fashion famouse. Otherwise really good game I would recommend it for any age from 5-adults so many games no adds and the other downside is there are games where it say you get free robux but you don't and its really annoying.😘❤🥰😍
1082,1083,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Madeline Duly,"I really adore this game although, you get heaps of bugs when i try to leave on certain devices it makes me have to restart roblox. I have to update it every single week on my chromebook which is really annoying. Right now its not letting me upgrade it i keep trying and trying , still not working.You have to pay REAL life money to not get bullied I learned that from experience. But the good things are that its a nice game that you can make friends with, just make it with the right people."
1083,1084,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,5,Carisaa Burdine,This app is amazing. But there are some things you must know that are not so good. In certain games there are very bad glitches. also there are very hard games. But some games on this app help you learn some things. Like to mention Bloxburg teaches you to work hard for Money and also it teaches you that bills are really hard to take care of. Overall this is probably one of my top favorite apps. Also you can have fun doing whatever you want. Just don't be a oder/online dater. Have fun 😀😎 byeee
1084,1085,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,3,Brian Pate,"This app is great. Theres many games that are optional to play. However, i recently discovered a problem, whenever im in the middle of a game it disconnects me. i checked my wifi and it was completely fine. I dont know if this is my phone or the app. Please fix this. Overall, the app is great."
1085,1086,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,2,seven,"I love the game but, I'm on mobile and when I do join some games, it keeps me in portrait mode and won't turn to landscape no matter what I do. This makes some game experiences horrible to play. I'm not able to play a lot of games that my friends do because of this problem. Please fix this!"
1086,1087,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Kosl,"I really like how you can play multiple games, make your own game and also play with other people inside those games, even though the updates they say are gonna be added and are really garbage, sometimes they never add it or remove it when added! The avatar system is most likely the fun part, you get to use robux you have to buy clothing and accessories! A lot of options on the app, a lot if storage to take but really fun! And the recording system is straight doodoo. But the game is really fun!!"
1087,1088,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,mohd ridhwan,Hello. And you know why I rate 5.Because I really like all the games that you have. And when I get boring I always play this game no matter WHAT!! And there is one game that I really like. Is adopt me because it's like adopting pets baby and yeah. Hope one day I will reach to my dream But there is one problem sometimes happen. 1.Its some times lagging when we join the game. 2.Some games are lagging then join another game. But hope you guys fix this😇😇😇
1088,1089,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Strangerthings Hi,It is great but some things are overpriced and then it deletes items from your inventory but you can send a request for your robust back but it keeps a nonpictured item in your inventory and but it never let's me play games even with good wifi sometimes I have full bars and then it disconnected me you should let us refund game passes please
1089,1090,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,3,Gacha life Jadah,I love this game but there is some problems I have with the game. Every time it needs an update I have to wait hours for it to be finished. It kicks me out the game to my homescreen The Jointstick always get stuck. I can't move my camera to look around sometimes. Other than that I don't really have any issues with the game. But I hope one day these issues can fixed.
1090,1091,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,Brent Love,"If you're looking for a game just to entertain you for like 3, 4 hours, then boom perfect game, you might get mad at some stuff cause sometimes there's glitches. But overall, it's about 5 stars recommend getting the game."
1091,1092,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,5,кιє_яα ʗooɭ,"Roblox is incredibly cool, but sometimes it will be lag/bug. Good WiFi is recommended when playing roblox. The game's are nice, good, and cool. I could say that using a bad WiFi to play, you will be stuck in the loading screen, or freezing in the middle of the game and disconnects. Sometimes having a bad WiFi make's a bad quality, it sucks. But anyways in my opinion roblox is nice, especially playing with a friend, or even playing with a friend group. So far I will give 8.5/10 for ratings."
1092,1093,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,VIDEO GAME MASTER 3765,This game is really fun and there are some robux and a couple bugs like sometimes I'm playing a game and whenever I try to move my screen it like extra extends the screen and zooms it in and out one of them trying to move it left right and it won't let me control my own screen and sometimes you glitch under the map and die whenever you like really in a community high levels so I think that should be fixed as well but other than that it's really fun so I'm giving it five stars
1093,1094,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Abigail McKinley,"I love it. It has every type of game you could want to play like fighting or roleplaying and those are a few. There are thousands of games to choose from like worrior cats to broken bones (which is really fun in my opinion) and best of all you can make your own games, you can also play all the games with your friends I have not seen one game where you are the only one playing, but I hope that this review helped 👋☺️"
1094,1095,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Renee Smith,"I love Roblox! I've been playing it for some time now, but it I have a tiny problem. Most games I play is so laggy! I have good internet. It kicks me out and I update my phone and closing the app.. It don't work. l've tried and tried. It doesn't work. I hope you can fix the amount of lag. Otherwise it's a good game. It's a very creative game. It has billions of games inside one game. It's so fun. All you have to do is give it some time for you to adjust to it. Thank you :)"
1095,1096,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,Al Flagg,It is a very fun game and whenever you want to play it you can play it but it's very annoying when I gets buzzed and it glitches and also when I am playing a game it doesn't let me turn and also the laptop keys are very glitchy so I think they should fix that and other than that a nice game you should play it recommended but you might want to make sure your phone isn't like caught up with stuff because it is going to glitch and I don't think that's a good idea
1096,1097,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Zalayah Hayes,"I gave 4 stars for a reason. It lags and whenever u hit the leave button and u were suppose to. It gets you're screen stuck and u only zoom in and out. I hope this stuff gets fixed. And I don't really like the new oof. Sorry, thanks for understanding"
1097,1098,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,2,Mick Ray,"Roblox is slowly getting worse. There's new exploiters almost every week and it's getting more laggy. It's still a good game but the games kick me off for no reason at random times and I know they aren't updating because I rejoin right after. And once again, I'm going to bring up limited faces. The cost of them is being brought up to over 100k robux, and not many people can afford that. There are still some good thing about Roblox, though it's hard to name them with how much worse everything is"
1098,1099,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,3,Kristinaa,"I like this game,, best game ever. But please fix abt the camera/screen its zomming in and out also sometimes freezing. I can't play well. sometimes/ in EVERY GAME it's freezing I can't move or click anything like it's hanging but it's not. I can click the navigation buttons, just the game."
1099,1100,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,inglinh codes,"This is a poorly compressed and poorly optimized version of roblox for the phone. It's to the point where you can't play with any less then 3 gigs of ram. Don't even bother running this with a lower end phone. It'll die. Then again if you have a good phone, this app is great!"
1100,1101,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,IronMongous,"Amazing game, so much variety (I mean there are millions of experiences) and endless opportunities! You can even make real money if you work hard enough. A solid 5 stars because of all the great memories, minus the community. Some games, like Da Hood, or The Streets, tend to have a lot of dodgy stereotypes, aka slenders or oders. This people online date a peer pressure friends found on the platform into dating, but you can just turn off chat and voice call your friends if you hate that stuff!"
1101,1102,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,mudkipmyman,"Honestly, this is my favorite game. Everybody should try it at least once. I don't care if you don't like it, more fun for us! And for those people who have issues with logging into their account, it's most likely your account either got hacked or roblox is having problems with their server."
1102,1103,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Mike Polisano,"Entertaining and time consuming although Everytime I go to buy robux it says payment successful or that I paid for it and then it doesn't give it to me another issue I have been experiencing is all the games I play when I pause it and then unpause it and try to move it zooms in and out,but overall it's a great game and I recommend it to anybody that needs entertainment from time to time and someone that's looking to kill time 🖤📌"
1103,1104,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Lily,I think its a great game.But they could make it ipad/phone friendly beacuse I usually play on a phone and it disconnects alot and lagging a bit. Overall I think ots a great way to hang out with friends so thats why I rate 4 stars.would recommended.
1104,1105,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,4,Abi Syamil,This game is the best game ever in my entire life! It has alot of games in it. You can play and create a games and more! But it has one problem from long ago that we couldn't use some words and causing me hard to explained it. It's not necessary that even some proper words can't be used. So I'm giving 4 stars as a rating. I might change my mind to give a 5 stars if the problem got fixed.
1105,1106,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,5,Exquisite Android,"This is like the YouTube of games, it's unlimited in what you can do! Very good game, tons of fun. I would make this four stars if everyone was experiencing lag all the time, but I think it's just my phone brand that's the problem. One thing that's not very good about the app is the overuse of censoring in the chat filter, but I know you guys have a lot on your hands, so I'm gonna not worry about it. Overall very great app, I would recommend it to everyone"
1106,1107,2022-06-17,2022,06,17,3,Rose Laberge,"Although I enjoy this app and its many games, it seems to lag quite more than wanted. It is hard to play a game when my character cannot move. At first i thought it was my WIFI but when i did further investgations (like playing roblox at other people houses) I soon discovered that it was not the WIFI the problem it was the app itself. Please find a way to fix this out going problem. Thank you!"
1107,1108,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,David Davis,I have so much fun playing roblox it's fun entertaining and funny it's so much more fun when. You get to play with your friends there's so much games. You can make friends change your avatar and more. The robux part is easy you can get it on Christmas on your birthday or pay for some. But sometimes it can get inappropriate with the online daters and toxic rude players hackers and game lag other than that it's incredible and awesome I denfintly recommend ps. It's very popular
1108,1109,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,4,Fania Aurora,"I like this game it's so fun and playing with friend and play multiplayer, and there is a few things that is not working 1. When I'm joining on a server it's dont load fully 2.when I play an obby some of the part is invisible and I keep falling beacuse I don't know where is the jump 3.when I play some sort of building my screen just freeze but not whole screen 4.the screen is not moving and I just can move the character and zoom in and zoom out, Roblox please fix this!"
1109,1110,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Hennisee Buchanan-Perrone,"It is a good app the only flaw is that recently I have not been able to get into roblox so right now I'm struggling wit that, but otherwise it would be a great app and y'all will enjoy it, a few days go by and I'm able to get back in but then I haven't used it for like a week and it won't let me log back in cause when I try to vertify it it says like it not able to arok right now try again later?? So can you please work on fixing this cause I really enjoy this app and Want to keep playing it!!"
1110,1111,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,_little_softie_,It's a really fun game. I would even tell people to play it .I like that you could play so much games and play with people and make friends. A thing I don't like is the updates like removing r6 etc and I also don't like is the lag. But in my total opinion it's a good game.
1111,1112,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,5,Feidge L. Cano,"The games in Roblox is good, but there's so many bugs when you play on Mobile and Tablets :) Just like when you were trying to move or swiping to look around.. It keeps zooming in and out ;-; . Fix that bug in Mobiles and Tablets. It's good too when you're gonna play in Computer but not everyone playing in Computer and mostly in Mobiles & Tabs. Just fix that bug, that's it :) . Yeah, Game is good. Yes,it's good. Not that bug:)"
1112,1113,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,TheSteveRemix,"This is a really good game, it's kid friendly and has plenty of online player-created games to choose from, won't delete this anytime soon! Edit: With the recent updates, things are getting worse. From music being unusable to the iconic 'oof' being removed, ROBLOX is now unfortunately something I may consider uninstalling."
1113,1114,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Marjohn Magdaraog,"This is good! ❤❤❤ I kinda like this game even if you create a game but using a pc, it might be a little different, I don't know where to create game. But a little amazing! Not just too many ads there are NON-Ads!"
1114,1115,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,5,Ijustwantyobloo.d 8,"It's an amazing game. So many games to play in so many catagories. The robux only cost to 48 cents or 5 dollars, it's very cheap. But, when my Internet is running just fine, it says disconnected. It's probably just a me problem, but still. IT'S AN AWESOME GAME. Also, HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!"
1115,1116,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,4,Phoenix Rising,"Great game. I love how it has something for everyone. (Mystery, Parkour, roleplay, etc). The games graphics are good aswell as the hair and clothing selection. Great way to make friends or to play with your own. Despite all these good attributes, it does have to cons. Like the constant updates, or the fact that if you don't have robux(which costs money) theres no way you could actually enjoy the game, or the excessive amount of hackers, scammers, trolls, and bugs-for a childens game."
1116,1117,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Myla Mooney,"I love this game it is like my only game that I have, it is super fun! And I enjoy playing it all day! It is family friendly and it is a great game to play on with friends. It has SO many games on it you can create a avatar and get cool accessories and outfits! So far it's is the best game I have played. It's very recommended from me!"
1117,1118,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,4,Foox,"This is a great game, but you should add back the feature to wear multiple hairs! This game is about creativity, right? There are so many creative hair combos that you can use for your avatar and it's sad that this is no longer a feature, you should be able to make your avatar the way you want it (appropriate ofc.) Other than this, the game is great overall and I do reccomend it. Thank you for reading!"
1118,1119,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Cassandra Naegler,"This is a really good game and it has a good variety of things to play!the game has fun games like royal high, and tower of hell. Adopt me and more, those are just few of many many games to lay your eyes on! Make sure not to be toxic and scam in game. You can get banned for days or even forever. You can report people if they do something bad, this game is 11+ my only problem is when I try to update it, It won't let me"
1119,1120,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Hacker Proof,"I mean this is more off an app with games which first of all is so clever besides that, this game is amazing you meet lots of people and make friends. I have a great time whilst I play, I don't think I have any negative thing to say apart of the max friends you can have. But like that's no big deal, Amazing game you should absolutely install it! Thumbs up 👍👍🤜🤛"
1120,1121,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Madnesson,"This game has a bunch of games you can play. You can even create your own game. There's also a bunch of cool gamepasses. (They cost money aka Robux.) It's super fun playing with your friends. You can join groups or create your own group. You can customize your avatar with so many cool things. But, some people bypass the chat filter, (you are able to turn the chat off in settings) there are tons of exploiters, and glitches that can ruin the game."
1121,1122,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Caden and Josh,I have been playing Roblox ever since 2016. This game has the best variety of games. You can make friends with people. And make your own world in Roblox. I definitely reccomend roblox to everyone. Although I am not a fan of the new 3D layered clothing because they don't fit around the characters well and it looks strange. Also they got rid of the Classic oof sound.
1122,1123,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Anise,"This is by far, my favorite game. HOWEVER- There are a few issues. First off, people stealing, and hacking peoples accounts. Second, sometimes when I join a game, my camera is messed up. And third, people do some..uh..bad stuff on this game, they seem to have found single color skins I guess, that make them apear...Naked? Thats it- For me anyways"
1123,1124,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Laila Bicknell,This is my favorite game and it is poplar but I have to download it to meny times I like it because it let's you decide your avatar but you have to pay for robux!!!!!! But so much fun with your friends and games !!!!!!!!!!! it's a fun but when you get mad at your friends because they friend request you ever day lol 🤣
1124,1125,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Leonel Khaled,This app is just amazing every time I have a few minutes of free time after work I use this app to to play for a really long time as long as I can it's really fun. I love playing adopt me and all the new pets it's just the beautiful new world look like the view is amazing it's the best app I've ever had
1125,1126,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,4,Shelly Nelson,I love this app so much! But there's something wrong- I leave the tab open for literally 10 secs and it says connecting for 4 mins like what the heck? Also if you try to close the tab then reopen it will glitch(for me) and my screen will freeze and the only way to unfreeze is to turn of your phone or your computer please check this roblox! Thanks 😊
1126,1127,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Kenni Nation,"Roblox is a great game, but the game has some bugs. When you join a game like Brookhaven or Bloxburg or just any game period, your character moves on it's own for a good 5 minutes. It gets really annoying after a while and I have to leave and join back for it to stop doing that. The game also makes me lag alot. When I am on mobile my game tends to kick me out and lags very badly and I just leave and play on my computer because it will not work well. I hope Roblox can fix these issues."
1127,1128,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Carly Wisener,"This is a great game so many characters ect!. ive been playing it for over 2 years now, its really addicting I dont know what I would do without it! You can make freinds and so much more, the only annoying thing is the tags fliter I know its because of bad people and stuff, but please let us atleast say some more? Lol anyways I love this app thanks for creating it."
1128,1129,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Jennifer Therond,Sometimes it bugs and I knock into stuff why can't we just go true the stuff every time and the thing that I don't like sometimes it glitches on me and sometimes they don't do correct and it goes very slowly and the button of 4 when we jumped doesn't work for me Please do it and I will give you 5 stars
1129,1130,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,3,- N o -,"The games good and all, but there is some major issues. The site is incredibly laggy, and I get booted off games often. Moderation is super sensitive and I've gotten banned / warned for the smallest of things. Some things i'd also like to see is increased limit on our about section. I also would like to see at least a small raise on the robux we make from selling clothes or gamepasses. Other than that, the games amazing considering i've been here since early 2018. The improvements are great!"
1130,1131,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,1,Lumen,"This game is terrible, it has trash optimization, runs horribly, slow, laggy, crashes constantly, takes ages to start up, it's completely unbearable. Years ago this game was fun, and it ran well, but now it runs so very poorly. Your 'game' is attrociously bad and needs major fixes."
1131,1132,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,cassandra reed,I have issues with this app and when I say issues I mean a lot of issues first is that the thumbstick is tiny on iPad and on Android it usually whenever you have the thingy when instead of having a circle it's that thing but literally every time you move or you you're moving but you click something wrong you zoom in and out you can never move and you cannot look to the left or your right and if you're zoomed in and that's the only thing you can be zoomed in you won't be able to look anywhere
1132,1133,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Isla Gettings,brillient game but i rated it a four star bc sometimes it just kickes u off the game for example when ur in the middle of a role play and it randomly glitches and then kickes u off. Other than that its an AMAZING game good for kids. U might need to change the age rating bc it says it's a twelve plus and somany kids play it. Like i said FANTASTIC game
1133,1134,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,MiaFaithPlayz,"Hello people! I am Mia and roblox is the best experience to play! Theres games from murder mysteries to aging up pets to adopting children to minigames! Its so much to even explain like whaaa.. Anyway, first sign in, its easy! Make a username! Anything you imagine!!!! Password next. Again, ANYTHING YOU WISH! As long as its in the limit of characters and if its appropriate. Okay byee have fun!"
1134,1135,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,5,Abdullah Darr,"This game is great ,the only problem is that we need games that work really smooth for 2gm of ram . It lags alot ,but now I'm used ti playing on my laptop so it's not really a problem otherwise this game is great ! Also please remove stitchface because there are too many slenders in the game with stitch face's on there characters . Also please make old roblox sign because I've seen too many people do that on YouTube,otherwise this is a great game ! Also there are too many connection problems."
1135,1136,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Sally Mccollough,"Very, very fun game! Although, like many others, I have the same issue of it only zooming in and out sometimes. Please fix this, it is very agravating. Besides that an amusing experiance."
1136,1137,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,4,Alex,"The app is REALLY FUN, but it upgrades soooooo much! I don't want to upgrade it as much as I do; it's very laggy, especially when you are on samsung mobile. (That is from experience, and I think a lot of people will agree. But I can't play it on my new laptop because it updated to something im not up to yet. ={"
1137,1138,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,Nma Mina,"I love this game!!!!!!! You should download this game you can a lot of friends! If you see a green dot press it and you can join your friends! Ther is like 1000,00 of games killer games, tycoon games, quite games, loud games I think. If wannt to see lots of games and play lots of games and play lots of games u should download it!But...there is one problem Today i couldn't chat anymore not in any more so I deleted it i searched but nothing so I had to redownload it so becarefull."
1138,1139,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,muhammad afzaal,"Hi,I rate this a 4 star because sometimes the upgrades can be really annoying. If you dont want one then it forces you to get one which I absolutely hate. Although it is a really adventurous and intresting free game! I would recommend this to all my friends. :)"
1139,1140,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,kevin banana,"The new roblox oof sound is horrible, roblox could've chosen anything for the new death sound. Out of all of the sounds, they chose the one that goes like ""gah"". That doesn't even sound like a death, and don't get me started on the lawsuit. Because they could've payed for a 2 second sound but chose not to. Please bring back the oof sound and I'll change this review to a five star."
1140,1141,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,5,Isaiah loves fortnite,I really enjoy playing Roblox because it is a game where you can let your mind be creative and wonder into an adventureous playful experience. You really can't get bored playing this game and don't NEED to spend money since most of the games are free and there is a HUGE variety to choose from. This may be a hated game but people really don't get the point. Which is to explore different games and make new hobbies and friends.
1141,1142,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,2,Tasa Ts,the game is alright but the oof sound is really just not how the game raised me and can you please fix the mixing hairs it really helps the avatars and taking it away really does nothing expect making people annoyed please fix the mixing hairs and theirs something called kohl's admin and I would really appreciate you trying to at least fix that but right now my opinion is staying at 2 stars the game isn't the game anymore.
1142,1143,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,5,Emi Duarte,"Definetley has improved. On the android version tho sometimes its stuck on the loading screen but i have an easy solution. Firstly either restart your phone or clear all your tabs and go back to roblox. Hope they patch it. I think why its cause maybe all your tabs might crash your game so yeah. 6:28 PM August 10, 2022"
1143,1144,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,4,Jordan Verheyen,I love this game so much . So many different games on it and you can play with so many friends. The only thing is I wish they had better free clothing for you avatar bc if you can't get robux you might be sad cuz you character looks bad at least one good free hair style. Sometimes the games glitch but it's understandable and it stops. But it's a Greta game none the less
1144,1145,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Shane Sean Lachica,very great game but the problem is 1. the has so much storage and you can maybe fix it by clicking a button that says delete all progress in a one game 2. i hate the bug that your game glitch and your character dont move or when you try to walk the screen moves its just annoying when i do a obby and 3. this Filipinos can relate if your just gonna lang or ang it don't work. it is going to be nice if you fix just one of this -shasean2402
1145,1146,2022-08-23,2022,08,23,5,Harley Messiah,"Roblox is just so addictional becasue there are so many games and updates. I never get board of playing, plus i have been playing since 2015 to 2022. If i'm honest i think that when you start roblox there should be a backstory behind how bacon hair was made. Now, one thing i want in brookhaven is a plane that u can fly. IM going to say this again, roblox is so addictional. Thank you for your time."
1146,1147,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Celeste Williams,"It's a really good game, however, i have only two problems, you can't create games on a mobile device and there a glitch that makes your screen stuck so you that you can't turn, and only zoom in. If you could change these it would make the game absolutely perfect for mobile players! Bring back the oof sound!!"
1147,1148,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,4,Maggie yeet,I love this game but there are a couple things you have to fix like bugs. sometimes I am playing with my friends and I go to join them and it says there offline and I get so mad so I wait like a hour to fix it. Also sometimes when you try to spin around it just zooms you in or out and it you have to leave then rejoin. Other than that I think this is the best game ever I think I have played!
1148,1149,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,3,Susan Bowman,I LOVE THE Game but 3 stars because of the lag and sometimes I have to Uninstall it just to play it.And sometimes when you move the player the camera moves to then I have to rejoin the game. But other than that the game is amazing!
1149,1150,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,5,Roberto and Cherish Behrens,"Sooo many games it's been amazing but there is always bugs that glitch me out off the game im playing its soo annoying! Please fix that. 😩 Other than that its very fun i recommend it as long as your ok with long waits and lots of bugs , also make there a way to get free robux $$$ . I think it's an amazing game tho hope this was helpful! 😁"
1150,1151,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,5,Edobor Joy,"Is a awesome and incredible experience and a opportunity to play with your friends, family and more. I love the idea and way of the creators because, yes, maybe is a game, but you have fun and learn some things. The bad things are the updated, the game is better, but you want to play and you read "" Updated"" in your screen, it is okay, it is still been a great game."
1151,1152,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,yeet okie,"This game is so great, it has a ton of games in one, and not to mention you can make games too, and customize your character better with robux. This isn't roblox's fault, but some gamepasses are so expensive, it's over 30 bucks sometimes in cash for something. Overall this game is amazing. The chat is strict because of creative ways people say bad things, I don't blame roblox for it."
1152,1153,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Ahmad Abiru,Roblox is the best. I love how users can make games themselves and hang with their friends. There are tons of games and tons of ways to have fun. My only problem is that the screen glitches randomly and can only zoom in and out.
1153,1154,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Itz Kawaiigirlplayz,"This game so fun !! i really like it , it have many game and have free skins too really love it edit:there a problem,when i was playing in a game it suddenly glitch me out the game i hope you fix it soon Edit:it remove the iconic off sound and replace it with this gah sound that sound like sneeze"
1154,1155,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,olfat ayoub,"Love the game! if someone asked me if they should dounloud roblox, then i would immediatly say yes!!! but there are a few things that i dont like. the first one is something alot of people talk about. they talk about the screen glitching and when you try to look arpund, you zoom in and out when you dont want to and the other thing is that i dont like the new oof sound so much so if you could bring the old oof sound back, i would really enjoy it! but TBH, i recomend to dounload roblox, its free!!"
1155,1156,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Elijah Little,"The Games Good, and has a lot of different games you can play! The only complaint I have is that the camera gets stuck pretty much all the time, and I used to be able to fix it by changing the camera mode, but that no longer works either! Anyways pretty ok game."
1156,1157,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Pam Tucker,Well my experience was great sometimes there will be bull's but it depends what game you play. The only thing that i don't like is that it needs updating all the time. Other than that the game is perfect!!😆
1157,1158,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Valerie Malinao,"As a Roblox player for 5 years I really can tell that there's an improvement on this game. But eventually, the lagging thingy is still there, and I want it to be fixed so the other players can experience the game smoothly. It's a good game."
1158,1159,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Lonfefe 246,"Very nice game but still, ban stitchface, toxic people are being created because of it and ruin our time on this platform, also please fix your servers because sometimes it gives me an ID connection in a game and I have to wait till tomorrow, then it says that they can't connect to their servers and then I have to wait another day! Please fix ur servers, but over all, it's very good!"
1159,1160,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,Rafael Bancajergan,"Its good and its a nice game that can play by many people it has good and nice quality but, sometimes when I'm playing Roblox its laggy, idk if its just a problem on my phone or problem on internet. But, I highly recommend to play this game, its really good, this is the best game u can play when you're bored or you cant do any, there'a bug sometimes but they can fix it. I only wanna say that please, please delete all account of roblox hackers. Past month, I got hacked but I got my acc back, TY!"
1160,1161,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Khafidzah Lubna,Sksksksks I love this app I can play with friends and can find online friends>\\\< This is the best game in the world!<3 but if I say another language its tag so please update the better than before!and if I get log out I log in with the same account and If I get the pass it isnt work but is it the right pass..and I don't have choice to make a new account:)
1161,1162,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,Claire Yang,"This game is very fun, however, when I'm in any game and click the Roblox button at the top left and then exit out of it, I can't look around (I'm on mobile). When I put on 1 finger on the screen and drag to try to look around, it just zooms in and out. It's only supposed to zoom in and out when I put 2 fingers on the screen... So that makes me have to rejoin and it's really annoying"
1162,1163,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,2,Twice Once,"this game was really pretty fun, i've been playing this for a year but suddenly i noticed that something was wrong about this app, it keeps kicking me out of the game and when i tried to play it again, it will kick me out again after 2-5 mins, please fix this, Thank you."
1163,1164,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,5,Sadie,"I love this app alot. It has alot of rping games, fighting games, anime games, ect. all of the games are soooooooo fun. I get to play these games with online friends, friends I acually know, and I get to play by myself ofc! This game also helps people to come out of their shell, and it gets people out of their comfort zone sometimes. You can create games for you and other people to play too! Overal I think this app is really fun, and a little helpful for younger kids."
1164,1165,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Usman Rayan,"This is a really fun game but there are some glitches,like sometimes the screen just start zooming in and out when I look around and there is a game sonic speed simulator,my favorite game I just can't join the game and I can't even leave I have to close the app and re-open it ,so if you can please solve this then it will be amazing and it's a pretty good game."
1165,1166,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,Gamer_Fox,"To those who says that they having the same issue which is the zoom in and out thingy, let me tell u that's no reason to give the game a 3 Star rate, it is super amazing that's why I give 5 Star rate. The zoom in and out thingy happens cuz u accidentally click multiple spots at the same time from ur screen causing these to lock the scrolling that's let you see around ur avatar, it can be solved by simply leaving and rejoining the game."
1166,1167,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,5,Gamers Club,I really like this game and I really recommend playing this app but there are several glitches like the camera glitch where you can't move your camera and you have to leave and join back to fix it. Roblox has has many updates with bug fixes but they aren't fixing the most important ones. (Only happens on moblie) but somehow the game isn't bad because of it its actually really good and you should try it!!
1167,1168,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Khushi Pindoria,"I love this game, the reason why I gave it a 4 star is because that after 10 or 5 days of playing, it gets laggy and it's very hard to move while playing on tablet. It works fine on pc but on mobile is it's hard to move around."
1168,1169,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,King Gamer20041,"I really really love this game so much and I rate this as a 5 star because it has so many games but here is on small problem and its that when you are playing lots of games it always have to have robux and also some small thing cost so much robux and I dont like that, but everything else is perfect. Thank you for making this app."
1169,1170,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Cemaria J,It really fun there was some glitches but not now and they have a lot of games to play and just the beat game I ever downloaded I really recommend for everyone you can do so much in this app and change your avatar into your favorite style most games or free to play not much to have to pay for again really recommend.
1170,1171,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Serina Aguirre,"Great game. I grew up on this game. My only issue is the Security 6 Digit Code. I get why it's there but, I lost the Google account my Roblox account was linked to. I had so much progress & just lost it. Not to mention all the robux I had used just to lose everything. However, other than that issue, I love the game. It is fun & easy to play. It also, is a great place to practice game programing."
1171,1172,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,4,Edenski Slovaski,"Generally this game acts as a promoter in shaping the creative minds of IT generation. There are more areas need to be developed in order to be more attractive such as transferable of cash money (generated from the park) to another party. The aim is to help the beginners or the poor players. Alternatively, the rich would be able to use his/her monies to develop other's theme park. Apparently, the servers may be slow in loading the park and at times they were lagging. Thank you."
1172,1173,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,4,Jerusha John,"It's a pretty good game - but a lot of problems- whenever I play a game- the camera acts weird after a while sometimes- I don't like it. And also, it's very annoying how glitchy it gets - and it sometimes also locks so when I try to look around, I can only zoom in and out. That is the worst glitch of all. Please please try and fix this."
1173,1174,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,3,Mazzilyn A.,"The games are fun to play and there are a ton of them, but the games always lag even if you have wifi. And it always has updates that you have to wait for. They are so annoying! It's fun to play with friends when you can but also a lot of games say they are one thing but aren't and a lot of games are either the same thing as another one or even more boring and shorter!"
1174,1175,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Springtrap Or William,"Its good, it lags at times, it often doesn't work with data but will on occasion, there are no adds, but the people on it aren't always the best but can't change that -Lefty"
1175,1176,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Khadija Cotton,I have an issue where my screen some gets stuck and only zooms in and out and I get kicked for no reason it says I have no wifi but I do and then I always get stuck jumping and most of the time I have to leave the game and rejoin because of the screen zooming in and out and people in this game act very inappropriate I don't not really. Recommend this
1176,1177,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,5,Bean S,It's a great game I love that there are hundreds of options for games to play it is its own style of game it is unique in its own ways there is one problem you can't play without buying necessities for that specific game if you could make it to where you can earn the items required for difficult missions in games that involve stealth it would be an even better game
1177,1178,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Terence Hawkins,"I am so glad this game exists, it keeps my spirits and mood high and it's super fun! I even tried making my own game but but by doing that i didnt have premium in the moment. Also, I don't have a laptop anymore due to summer break. other than that great game roblox! Keep up the good work!! Okay so this is me in 2022 and i heard you deleted the oof sound. When i heard this i got from pretty upset to VERY upset. So im keeping this 4 stars. This oof is not good at all."
1178,1179,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,A.C,"Honestly one of the best games online on mobile, however every game has issues, sometimes my screen just locks into zooming in and out in opposite directions when I try to move it left or right? Then when I turn my screen landscape the whole screen turns grey and I can't do anything but close the full game even when I'm playing a game,the game has no actual secure safe system yes it blocks out word but some of them aren't offensive the real problem is the reporting system it does nothing"
1179,1180,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,xXItz_BellaXx,"This is like the best game ever! It has so many games to pick and there is many kind of types like horror, survival, roleplaying and so many more! I just love roblox so much I have been playing it for many years. I really recommend on downloading roblox since u can do so many things there like making your avatar, making new friends from all around the world, and playing games. Well what are u waiting for? Hurry and download roblox now! Maybe I could meet u there and we can play together :D"
1180,1181,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,4,Andrew Pix,"While the game is great, this is more of just an issue. When trying to purchase robux, the correct screen does not appear anf instead the menu goes dark. The only way to buy them is in a game but then they get immediately spent on whatever you were trying to purchase, thus, if you want say, 1000 robux, but don't have 20 dollars, it is literally impossible to get."
1181,1182,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Catherine Gomes,"It is so fun. Many luxury and many survival games to explore. It is very simple to sign up. Just enter your birthday, any username you like, enter a made-up password (DON'T FORGET IT!) , pick your gender and start having fun! But there is one point to change. BUYING ROBUX!!! You have to pay to get it, but it doesn't make such a big difference compare to when you have robux."
1182,1183,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,•AA•,"Great game ! I love the feature were you explore different games FOR FREE! I'm not a big fan of the bombarding you to buy Roblox, but there are compromises to that. Overall 9/10 recommend this game if people are in the mood to explore different genres in one game. LOVE IT 💯👍🏼💞"
1183,1184,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Bryce Tim Gade2009,"This was a great game and I love it So much! You can go play with friends and lot of choices to play, I love to play bloxfruit but sometimes it always fps drop. I didn't know if this game is optimized or my phone have a problem. If not please optimize the game soo I can play smoothly, and my last problem is the connection. I already have strong connection but it's still lagging. Can you please fix it."
1184,1185,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,Virginia Brown,"I feel like this game is amazing I love it my 2 brothers love it, it is amazing 👏. The main reason why I love it is because I can create my own avatar and play games inside a game like that is cool!!! But It will need some changes because it has a lot of OD in it and that has to stop ✋️ and also I think that whoever even hackes once will be an automatic ban unless they has permission from the creator or co-owner but unless no. But overall amazing game! -Virginia's opinion"
1185,1186,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,3,Paxtyn Cook,"Buggy, in many ways, sometimes the camera fuses with the joystick, or, the camera just stops moving left , right, up or down, and only moves in and out, overall games are good! but these have been reoccuring bugs for me and my friends for years. overall 3 stars"
1186,1187,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,3,Ty& Lucian Hill,"It is a really good game. Has many options. There is a downside though, whenever you open the drop down menu when you are in a game it messes up the camera without fail. And also tower of hell and misery are pretty much impossible for most people so that it kinda bad."
1187,1188,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,panda,it has so many good games but i sill like it i have been playing for 4 year and lately I have been having some issues with it has been lagging a lot and other stuff it's really laggy with mobile its so laggy and I hate it so right now my favorite game is bloxburg and when I'm doing like the pizza thing It's super laggy and I think it's kind of annoying but still with all that I love it I've been playing so long and you get to play with your friends😊😊
1188,1189,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Kiki,I have left this game a 5 stars as it is an app I would recommend. It has so many fun and intriguing games to play. You can discover and explore new games every day. If you have a lot of spare or free time I would definitely recommend playing it as there are so many iffernt varieties of things you can play.
1189,1190,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Mariah Mendez,The game is really fun and all and no ads and stuff like that but I've been having some problems for it lagging I don't know if it's because my tablet is old cuz it's 2 years old but other than that the app is great one thing I don't like about it is that when I try to upgrade it almost every time it tells me to delete a game or two games one time it even told me to delete four games and I had to download them back so other than that this game is incredible fun and sometimes you could play
1190,1191,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,roblox planecrazyhead,"Well the game is so fun, but overall it keeps crashing everyone time I charge it to a point where it crashes please fix this. And what bring it to 2 stars is that EVERY time I enter my password on this device and then it says that I got the password wrong WHICH MAKES ME LOOSE MY MIND AND I DID NOT GET HARDWARE BANNED."
1191,1192,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,5,Anwesha Adhikary,"Great game, excellent performance. No complaints. Love the fact that you have options to games you wanna play! Love the updates, just wish it would updale according to the season. Just would like to see it, no pressure."
1192,1193,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Marcus Rizk,"This is the best game I'll also tell you the games! Adopt me and other stuff!but I give it an 4 tho because of the glitches for mobile like when I start moving the camera moves with it so then I have to leave the game and lose all my stuff! But it's worth it for the robux! 10.00$ for 800 robux? Amazing! And the other glitch, it when I turn the camera left the camera goes up! Littlery so annoying!! Please fix that bugs!"
1193,1194,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,5,Maija Mobley,"AMAZING. Works surprisingly well on my Chromebook. I have just a view problems. 1) I can't change my computers view, like in a flying game, it doesn't work. 2) I have a few games that are REALLY laggy. But other than that, it works really well!"
1194,1195,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Cassidy Arnett,"Love it, I have played for 5 years, I have found a very good rp game based on warriors book set,of course there is fighting and rp games, I think every one should have this game 10 stars, I highly recommenden computer, or phone. EDIT Now 6 years! Still love it! although on phone, you may need to start it then leave then start it again. Bye! Edit N.3:I have something to ask, I was wondering if you could make it to were you can send picures in friend chats, POOF"
1195,1196,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Zara Jacobs,It's so cool how u get to explore all these amazing games and make avatars and do fun things. I would've rated this app 5 stars but there are some problems like when u wanna say something it hashtags some words and I understand for bad words for kids but not every word that isn't bad so please fix that. Also I don't understand why we need to pay real money for avatars it's ridiculous. But other than that the app is amazing 👏
1196,1197,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Zen Insane,"This game is perfect to play when u are bored because there are games with many categories like shooting, Obby, racing, simulator and many more. But the problem there is no way to get free robux I know we can sell t shirt but no one likes to buy a t shirt in roblox. Anyways, there should be achievements and daily rewards that give robux. Afterall it's a great game.👍"
1197,1198,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Shahbaa Alkhalidi,"Ive been adictad to this game. It is a fun game where you can add friends, custimize your character (some items are free), you can buy robux to buy things that are not free,buy premium(robux), and play a lot of games.You can also create games, and chat with your friends or sibling or what ever you cam also play on any divice witch makes it really enjoyable. Ive been playing this game for lets just say more then 7 years you might wanna go ahead and download it its the BEST game ever in my opinion"
1198,1199,2022-06-12,2022,06,12,4,Gold Steel,"A great game, but the only problem is lag. My phone has 8GB RAM and always has at least 3GB of RAM free at all times. At most, this game takes 1.5 GB of RAM. My internet is great, and my phone is great. The in-game quality settings do not reduce lag by any more than +-2fps when going from one extreme to the other (highest setting to lowest and vice-versa.) This lag is just as bad no matter what game I play in Roblox."
1199,1200,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,5,Nurqisya wafa Binti norasraf,"It's so fun I can play with my friends but there's two bugs, first the screen is can't turn but instead of zooming in and out and opposite and two sometimes when I play the game was bit laggy and it's hard to play but I'd tried my best to play"
1200,1201,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Tomato _soup_,Its a good game and I have been playing for about 4 years now but the past few weeks or so there has been some problems including a new group of hackers but that should be fixed and they have taken out an iconic sound and that has kinda just made it a not as fun game anymore but its still really good to me
1201,1202,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Video_Games246,"I really like the game, I feel like it would be better if they didn't tag things like 'hug' or 'pretty' because then it looks like your being mean. Overall it's a really good game, that's really my only flaw besides the fact it takes virtual money to try to do things like create your avatar or create a group."
1202,1203,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,1,TheOfficialProGamer,"When the update comes, it began to lag too much, fix this trash update 😀, I'm experiencing lag in Bloxfruit, because of this update, the bug is called ""movement lag,when I dash/walk, my screen every movement is fps dropping! Bruh I have 4/64 GB oppo a16 model, it's good on other games such as Call of duty mobile/PUBG mobile, but when only ROBLOX?! I lag on ROBLOX?! The hell? Fix this as soon as possible, The bug is ""movement lag, fps dropping when you dash/walk and the walls is getting glitch"""
1203,1204,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Random user,"Roblox is a great game. You can hang out with your friends or make new friends but there is one problem, your screen glitches and it keeps zooming in and out which i dont like. Please fix the problem"
1204,1205,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,LegoMan Leland,"Roblox is a good game but there are problems with it. Firstly the cost for robux is alright if your buying 40,80 and 400 but for 1,700 robux it costs up to £20 and 10,000 robux is £100. I get that they need money to make the game better but the robux over 400 is too expensive(in my opinion). Also there are a lot of bugs and glitches that ruin the game. Finally there are a lot of hackers and toxic players that bully you because of your avatar. I think It's a good game but to much bugs."
1205,1206,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,5,Annamaria Roblox gal,"Roblox is a friendly game, only for people who share addresses and do bad things, the game also has no adds, but wrote of the games are super laggy and disconnect me and my friend when on a call, overall this game is fun and great, and you can make a bunch of new friends, you can also shift lock to do glitches, and the games are mostly family friendly! Roblox is recommended to download and it's a very good game!"
1206,1207,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Dashion Playz,"There is this glitch in every game where sometimes when we want to look to the left, it glitches and sometimes faces us in the opposite direction and it is very annoying. Please fix this bug, roblox and I hope it will not do that again. Thank you."
1207,1208,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Mritul Phukan,"The game is good, genuine content and all that but after a year or so of playing it gets a bit boring since you've already played a lot of the games. If you're scared it will give you a virus, don't be. It's totally safe, but remember there might be some people sending links in different games or in your DM's and those might contain viruses but the game is safe."
1208,1209,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,2,Isah Binti Umar,"Very good game! But theres 4 problems/bug, 1:why if i want to walk the screen following like i control my screen? If i walk to top the screen following 2.when i want to move screen left/right the screen just zooming in/out 3.when i want to walk the screen moving right for nothing.. lastly, if i jump and then die on every game/server, i spawned again,and why the jump tapping like a ghost tapping it:(... Pls fix this bug...hope you notice this ty! And sry bad grammar:)💔"
1209,1210,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,3,Kitty-Kat B,"I was going to some games and notice A LOT of weird stuff, i joined a game and it was all weird, so it wouldnt let me leave or disable chat and sometimes in other games it exits the WHOLE game out.. If this is somthing you can fix, Please fix it, and sometimes the game just crashes and said please retry opening Roblox or smth, so i think that was a glitch bc it doesnt happen often, Please fix this if you can! Thank you."
1210,1211,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,3,Toaster Oven III,"The Game itself is good, but I installed today, and it stopped working after an hour, giving me constant messages to check my internet connection, even though I have LTE data and am connected to 780 Mbps wifi. I have tried clearing cache, uninstalling and reinstalling, and messing with the settings, and nothing works. Until this gets fixed, my rating sadly is 3 stars."
1211,1212,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,kae suha,"This game is a very fun game, it cures my boredom and a lot of minigames are published by creators who play this game. There are alot of bugs and lag in this game but that doesn't mean that it is a trash game. Developers need to see the reports of a player more often though as it makes the game alot better. That's all thank you."
1212,1213,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,3,Serenity Rodriguez,"It is a great game. But at times my screen would glitch out and I would not be able to move forward only my screen,Now that is SUPER ANNOYING! And how much robux costs is also annoying that is why so many people don't like it. Overall it is a great game though fix those mistakes and it will be better."
1213,1214,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,5,Ariel Batson,"Hello there,i wanted to say some things about what you can do. Well to start off the list your allowed to block players,which means they cant go on your profile,you cant to on theirs and vise versa. Which is helpful with some bot players. Your also allowed to unblock someone if you accidently blocked them. Now mainly your allowed to unfriend,and friend people the max is 200 friends. One more thing is that you can have multiple security set ups to not get hacked(its still possible just not as ez)"
1214,1215,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Kaiden Storm,"Amazing game for children!! There just a little concerned reason about this game, it has somewhat a lot of cyber bullying, but most of the time it's just playing around I'm really glad that you can not put anything bad in the chat and send it without the hashtags that come up and take it off. A very good game with creative games and fun games, and even people can make new games! Very very good game 👍"
1215,1216,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,4,Michael Smith,"In my opinion roblox is a great game really, it has its pros and cons, but there's to many cons in my belief. On xbox you cant chat in game which I think should be added, and there's are too many error codes for xbox aswell, it would be great if they added chat options on xbox and if they fixed the errors, but overall roblox is a great game, but I think it needs more fixes."
1216,1217,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Zoe Pottinger,This game is very fun but it's kinda annoying if you're on mobile because there is a glitch were the screen zooms out. But that's the only issue I had from this game but overall it's a very fun game and there are so many game's to play.
1217,1218,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Fundycannotbefound,"It's really fun owns ENDLESS possibilitie's and so so creative! Fun seeing what other's have done. Overall it's really fun you could draw, play an obby, try doing tower of hell, even a tycoon to! But really the game is here for you to have fun! Here are some of my favourite games. Spray paint, speed draw, Tower of dreams obby, bloxburg, BAHASF, I know they were alot but there are alot of good ones to!"
1218,1219,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,Kato_With An_Axolotl,"Great game! Started playing in 2015 and have loved it ever since! I do have one minor issue currently, when trying to sign in on my chromebook the verification barrier is very buggy and after completeing it, it won't let me sign in and says there was an issue."
1219,1220,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Emily Feely,"This game is slowly tumbling down to its death. even though I still like this game it's not as good as the old times. sure it was really laggy but that's when David actually listened to people. They removed the oof sound with a way uglier one, The community it's so bad at the moment and the fake hackers and real ones like crossroads. I don't get why the admins can't actually make players happy like with, actually good items tha at free and are fairly priced and good moderation."
1220,1221,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Timon Don,Okay game but it has in the last year some stupid updates going on like that it says that you don't have Internet but you just have full wifi connection and on mobile the camera is sometimes glitching but on that note pretty good game. i have some roleplay tips if you want Called Greenville [free] Brookhaven [free] Bloxburg [25 Robux] I hope roblox can fix maybe some problems.
1221,1222,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Cason Brooks,This a very good game I enjoy playing it allot but there is some flaws for the mobile players the game is very glitchy allot of the time and my games keep crashing and then says loading experience and it will do the for 30 minutes and still not work. It's overall a great game. If you're able to fix this then it would be perfect.👍
1222,1223,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Amelia Brittain,"I love the game honestly but the only 2 problems is the updates and pausing I can never actually play the game, now I know it's to fix glitches but I have no other games on this device and I have to keep on deleting things to update it 😢 Aside from this the app is great!"
1223,1224,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,5,xXiiiFrxida&JxssaiiiXx,"This is an amazing game, although there is something that happened to me a few days ago. I was just playing roblox, till i suddenly disconnected it looked like the server just crashed so I joined again. But it said that the server crashed again, I redownloaded the app but still it kept crashing. I tried to play another game still the same thing. Please fix this!! other than that. This is an amazing game and i recommend it! ☺"
1224,1225,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Maci Miller,The game needs a little more detail in a lot of the games. Also I hope you can fix the glich where you can't turn your screen I'm tired of always exiting out of the app to fix it also I wish robloxnitems for your avatar weren't so expensive. Also the ban policy is....yea no just a 👎.Also the chat tags are WAY WAY WAY WAY TO STRICT.if you could fix these things it would make roblox soo much better
1225,1226,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,2,Anthony Jensen,"I really like the games and the new tops and bottoms, but it doesn't provide in every game. The majority of walking animations have gone wrong, and the new death sound stinks, I really love the ""oof"" better."
1226,1227,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,3,Abdul moiz,"Good game but it starts lagging everytime so I am going to tell the lags 1. It does not load properly 2. Sometimes I can't turn my camera like I am playing Daycare 2 so I can't see the monster and it's minions 3. Sometimes the foot of the player does not work. So, everytime I reinstall it it works perfectly thanks."
1227,1228,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Dustinriyu Borja,I been playing this for 1 year now almost 2 year and it's the best game I had ever played I play this game everyday also bug where ur screen gets stuck it's no problem on Brookhaven or just try opening the menu and swipe left and right it's that easy to fix
1228,1229,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,1,Isobel Scott,"At first, this game was great, but then it got to the point where I had to reset my character 5 times per game because it froze, or I couldn't control my character. Another problem is a more personal one, but, my friends have been pulled into the game, and no longer want to communicate, or do anything that isn't play roblox. They have actually skipped school several times just to play. All in all, I am not one to speak for others, but i wouldn't get this game."
1229,1230,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Shubham Pochhali XII B,"Very good game, I really, really loved it, has a lot of games! Just to improve the camera movement because some times I can't control the camera movement and my joystick starts controlling the camera. Improve this Roblox Corporation because this is the worst glitch in Roblox in my opinion. Except this I can say that everyone could have faced this problem that this game takes a lot of data. Well, I know that usage of data depends how much is the server size of the game you're playing in this."
1230,1231,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,Jason and Rebecca Shortino,This is so much fun it has so many different games it's sooo fun but there just one thing I'm also on a phone but IDK if it dose it to ether ppl the game kicks me out for no reason I checked my internet but it's not my internet and it just kicks me out and I have to rejoin it like freezes. But its really fun also I don't like how you have to pay 25 robux to play bloxburg it's kind it's pretty much really fun . So that's why I gave it 4 star's I love this game <3
1231,1232,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Imelda Pascua,"I was supposed to rate this a 5 star since its fun, but its because of my avatar, I've bought clothes back from 2020-2021 but most of them don't appear, but they appear in my other devices (tablet and Ipod), also when I save my fits/avatars and play a game, its automatically gone when I leave a game, and customize my avatar, please fix this issue."
1232,1233,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,2,Kessy de luna,"I will gonna talk about bugs, first of all the screen bugs it happens in most of mobile players is when you tap the menu while playing and when you go back to the game when you try to move your screen it just zoom and you can't rotate it, second is the jump button i don't know if it's only happen to me or to the others too but sometimes when I try to jump it bunny hoping when I'm not even touching the jump button and also I have good internet connection but why the game is take so long to load."
1233,1234,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Devon Clark,"Personaly, I love roblox, I've been a member since i was a kid. I would for sure reccomend this games. But one thing I would say is how many exploiters and people who write/do innopropriate things on this game. If you want, or you want your kid to stay away from that stuff, then i would reccomend playing a harmless game like, Adopt Me, Bloxburg, Brookhaven, obbys, ect. Overall, I would reccomend! For kids, and for teens!"
1234,1235,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,Jackie Schult,"Roblox is a truly amazing app. But my daughter always complains on how there isn't free items. So I bought ""Premium"", so she didn't have that problem. But still, please fix it. Add some more items to the game. Another thing, is when my daughter's game is glitching. She finds it too hard to play, and she says sometimes, when she is talking with someone I the game, she can't reply. That's what she complains about the most. Please fix these issues. But overall, this is an awesome game."
1235,1236,2022-07-16,2022,07,16,5,Vickie Rennick,It's really fun and there are no ads. There are many games you can play. You can make friends and you can also Play some games that are scary but meant for kids. I mainly like it because it pretty much helps me with overcoming fears. Well some of them. but otherwise the game is really fun! Others that do not have Roblox can try it out sometime. It's really fun and all ages can play!
1236,1237,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Sevhton Delos Santos Espiritu,"Very epic game but one issue for mobile players, there's sometimes a glitch for the screen, it triggers when your walking and while doing so click the pause or menu button at top left. It's really annoying hope roblox fixes it"
1237,1238,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Holly Shumake,"I have deleted apps, I have deleted several videos and photos, Just so that I could update this app. But, every single time I try to press update, it starts to update, but it never actually goes through. Smh."
1238,1239,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Chris Moore l,Amazing game and a huge variety of different mini games all in one. Lots of good customisation options for your character as well. Would highly recommend. 👍
1239,1240,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,5,william pearson,"This game is so fun! I see why a lot of people miss old roblox, and hate new roblox, but i joined in 2019, but, the oders,slenders,cnps is the problem but I never experienced it, but anyways the game is fun this game is totally recommended for kids and older but maybe a better experience for teens because there's bullies fighting and violent games but in my case I like the game!"
1240,1241,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,Fernando Zarate,"Im gonna keep my rate at five stars because of the epic new games that are being released, but theres just a little problem.. half of the stuff i owned are just gone. Ive tried to see if it was just my phone so i restarted it and still, roblox is already updated, and soon i gave up. Other than that great experiences!"
1241,1242,2022-06-03,2022,06,03,4,Roblox Ak12,This is a really fun game I'll say that. But one thing I'll say that annoys me is that if your on mobile and you accidentally press the tabs button on your phone the game controls glitch like the movment mode moves the screen or the screen movement makes it size your screen and its very annoying. Please fix it.
1242,1243,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,3,Angelina Zhylyak,"I used to rate this app a 5/5 but its dropped. Sometimes the bugs in this app are UNBEARABLE... It's a huge app so I understand but they really need to take time to fix these bugs. It's was fun until the point where I couldn't open the app because it said I had no wifi connection. Every other app on my device worked flawlessly so that certainly wasnt the issue. Servers in the game are a pain too. I hope the creators take more time to do bug updates more often. Besides this flaw, its great!"
1243,1244,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Ojaswi Pydi,"best game ever I mean like besides for having better actual avatars for robux,it's really good. There are a lot of good games and literally no ads. Personally I hate when I try to join a game and there's an error but that's just on my internet. Good Game u should download it it's basically the app store without using money. Done"
1244,1245,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,3,Mariachi Lee,"This always happens when im on phone and its getting on my nerves, when I try logging in it says ""incorrect password"" when i know I did it right and it only happens on phone and never my pc. Ive tried redownloading the app so it would stop but it still does the same thing. Could you please fix this? Its good game n all but its jst pissing me off atp"
1245,1246,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Parker Kantz,If u have a low storage phone this is somewhat better because this app had so much games and different experiences to choose from so I like this game because of this even though I have a lot of storage it's easier because then I can save my storage for photos and stuff!
1246,1247,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,Matthew Villin,"I grew up on this game, I always enjoyed it. BUT all of these stupid updates are ruining the game. It's becoming too advanced and confusing. It always glitches and I can barley play sometimes. My wifi is always connected but there are so many bugs. Not to mention the TERRIBLE security system. There are so many hackers and the game itself has been hacked so many times. It's ridiculous. Please for the love of God, fix your damn game. I'm tired of it. I'm on the edge of not playing anymore bc of it"
1247,1248,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Gallardo Jenant Jean,"I love playing this game but all i can recommend if they do update is to make the jump button bigger because when your playing in mobile the jump is to small to click it annoys me that you cant click it properly especially when the game your playing is a parkour game like mega fun obby , tower of hell , tower of misery ,etc. So one thing i can recommend is make the jump button more bigger for mobile players but overall good game 👏"
1248,1249,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,Tab Tap,This is an AMAZING game and really recomend it but there is a small issue.You need the internet to play and it really bothers me so it would be great if that could be change that! Other than that is is a REALLY good game and worth time on it!!!!!
1249,1250,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Stavriani Antonia,"This app is a!azing I have been playing it for 2 years and it's like the most amazing game but there is some bugs and it does glitch but it doesn't happen normally to me! I would recommend this game it's an adventure in the Roblox world,u should download it!"
1250,1251,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,3,Ham,"I keep having trouble with microtransactions, I have no idea if the problem is about my current locations but everytime I want to buy the 1$ pack of 80 robux I confirm the purchase then it won't actually complete it and say I can only use the funds in the United States which is where I currently am keeping in mind I was just in Mexico a couple weeks ago and mightve made an accidental change to billings account but the confusing part is that I was able to buy the robux once even with the errors"
1251,1252,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Elsa Princess,"I absolutely LOVE this game there are SO many choices to play but sometimes it can be just a little slow,and when you start off with no robux the dressing up options are...limited but other than that i give it 5/5 stars!"

It's a game 🎮 you should try, although it lags some times and has some issues sometimes. Like there was a time when my screen Lagged and it literally kicked me out of the game But still great game the reason why I have played this game for 2 years I don't understand why you don't get robux when you first get into the game"
1253,1254,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Kate Webb,"For people looking for a HELPFUL review, here. Roblox is a game with a bunch of games inside of it made by other players. You can create games, clothing, decals, etc. You can play with friends, and also friend people that you bond with. Roblox has a safe chat system for kids under 13. It tags out Cuss Words, inappropriate things, addresses, and personal info. There are restuarant games, obstacle courses, roleplay games, and much more! Games I recommend: Bloxburg, Tower of Hell, MM2! Bye!"
1254,1255,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Ashley Karn,I love this app I played almost every day with my friends It is a very unique app and I just love it It has a little bit of everything It has from role play games to horror games and it's online so you can play with different people and meet new people as well and make new friends. PS if you were reading this and you work for the Roblox I would love it if you would add something that a horse lover would like to play that is not a role play or a like kind of like a rodeo game.
1255,1256,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Brooke Devine,"Great app. No doubt about that at all! I have been playing it for years and it is amazing! There is some many games to choose from that you will find something you like! The only is scammers and hackers. I know it isn't Roblox's fault for this but I think they could do more for it! But 5 stars, they deserve it!"
1256,1257,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Amiyah Perryman,"It is so fun and I get to make friends and I get to have kids, houses,and family. It's kinda like real life.i get addicted but not too addicted. I really like it because my real friends like to play it so I friend them, and play a lot of cool games...... like cotton obby,tower of dreams,and the coolest 😎 and kinda ( REALY ) scary 😨. If you're reading 📚 this you should really play some obbys such as...... cotton obby it is really really fun, but it might get a little frustrating that ok 👌😅"
1257,1258,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Barbie world,"This game is amazing u can make friends,play with people it has tons of games to play it's the perfect game but, they added voice chat last yrs November, the added voice chat wich I think is amazing for ppl older then 17+now its for everyone my opinion is that this isn't a very good idea since kids play this game now they talk to strangers without filter wich could lead to bad situations,as them giving personal information.."
1258,1259,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,5,Alexander Drysdale,Great game! Ive been playing since 2014 and its still good😅 but there is one bug that is very annoying if you put three or more fingers on the screen it will glitch and you will only be able to zoom in and out. The only way to solve that is to get in a car in a roblox game.

1261,1262,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Vanessa Cabrera,"Good soup, lots of good people on this app. Some might be rude but overall good experience, I do wish for some games to allow all kinds of devices to play, not just PC. Would add more things for people to look forward to."
1262,1263,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,5,Billy Bobbie,I love that I can play with my friends and family now one thing I am getting annoyed about is when you look up a specific game you find like 500 other games that have the same name like squid game and some tycoons so yea. Update: here's a suggestion we should be able to get like 20 robux for free once every 1 or 2 days just a suggestion.
1263,1264,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Angie Nelson,"This game is super fun and You can play with all of your friends. My only complant is that I wish to play cats life which is a pc game. I have a Pc of my own and I am not allowed to play. It says ""This game is not made for your device"". I soon hope that you or me can reach out to the creator or you may fix this problem. I still rate 5/5, with no other side complants. Thank you for your time."
1264,1265,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,5,Itz Rogelio YT,"A very interesting game I've ever had, but I encountered so many bugs in this game. The first thing is, everytime I move around, it keeps zooming in and out instead of changing directions, even in the thumbstick part. Sometimes the experience took a long time to load even my internet connection was fine. The second thing was, the tags. I always annoyed with tags for something I want to say in my own language. Please remove this feature and fix some bugs as soon as possible."
1265,1266,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Sabahat Saleem Iftikhar Hameed,"This game is very entertaining and challenging.

Talking about the controllers on mobile phones is that whenever it lags a bit it just walking itself, i had to leave and join again but when it comes from VERY LAGGY situation, my phone freezes and won't turn into normal, it suddenly restart my phone. I had to shut it down and restart it over and over again, you gotta fix this bug Roblox."

1271,1272,2022-06-17,2022,06,17,4,Nada Nody,"such a nice game, but so many bugs. You need to fix this as soon as possible mostly in mobile players. ;Sometimes your screen cannot be turn around. When you're swiping it's just zooming in and out. My screen will freeze for 10 sec, then when it start moving it will just shake so much. It's not a phone problem. It's the game. I've seen so many people experiencing this"
1272,1273,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,4,Tonnia Vugutsa,"The game is absolutely amazing but it's just the bugs that make me abit frustrated. One of them is the camera and I'm sure most mobile players are experiencing this too,it just freezes and it makes me leave the game then rejoin in order for my camera to work perfectly again. Apart from that I think the game was well made and I hope you could fix the bug. Thx😁👌"
1273,1274,2022-06-03,2022,06,03,4,Yaya UwU,"The best game ever to play! So the problem is, 'the screen movement'. Whenever i was trying to move the screen it will zooming the screen. I can't do anything instead to leave the experience and rejoin. Or sometimes it's the opposite. And the 'jump glitch'. My avatar will jump non-stop while playing game until my friend help me. I'm not sure if i explained it perfectly but please fix this bug :)"
1274,1275,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,4,Xiao Li,"I love this game so much🖤🖤🖤,but The problem is that we need robux to buy hair, clothes, character, movements, face, and other things According to the evaluation, it is a really wonderful game. We can play with friends more than 1000 games, and we can also make game , I was going to put 5 stars but it's because of the rubox, it's easier for players to give them 5 rubox every day and why i can't log in the problem it's not the wifi it's the phone ???"
1275,1276,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,4,Danielle Loucks,"I love this game so much! The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star game is how many times you disconnect before you enter. Although, it has definitely improved in the past month or 2. I would definitely recommend if you want to play many different genres of games in one game. It's like billions of games in one app. I definitely recommend! Edit: another problem is that the filter system blurs out a bit to much. Numbers, names, and more are not safe from the filter."
1276,1277,2022-06-02,2022,06,02,4,Daphne Tio Luo Wen,"Believe it or not,this is the only game on my phone but there are just 2 problems. 1. When l'm in the middle of an obby,tycoon or whatever,suddenly the camera,instead of moving,just keeps zooming in and out to the point where l just have to quit it. 2. Is it just me,or the fact that my character keeps jumping up and down even when l wasn't pressing the jump button happens to everyone? I would've given this a 5 star if you at least fix these problems!"
1277,1278,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Sherlock Holmes,"It's an okay game. It's just hackers. I've got my account hacked lot's of times and it's frustrating. Thing is, this has been happening SINCE 2016. Please. You NEED to fix this because people are in DANGER. A 5 year old could be playing this. Please. Overall an okay game."
1278,1279,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,4,Joneny,"Great game, but here's some flaws/bugs. 1: On a Amazon Kindle, you can't even play popular games such as Brookhaven, Adopt Me, MeepCity, and more games. 2: My iPad in the lock screen of the game never works, and I can never load it but if I close the game and reload it. But the game yours is so good Roblox. I would definitely give it a 5 for the game but 4 for the bugs and stuff, But also 5 for the experience So 4 for now but the rating all put together is a 13. I love your game so much really!❤"

1282,1283,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,3,Leona,"I love this app. But the only reason I get frustrated from this app is when it says, ""connection error"" when the connection is perfectly fine. It won't let you play at all. Also, some games get super glitchy and it's very annoying. Please fix this problem Roblox. Thanks."

I gave this a 4/5 rating because my child loves it, I had a try and it is lovely! My only concern is that it is quite addictive and tht you have to pay for robux but overall just a great game for any ages. There are also multiple choices of games such as roleplay , obbys , creative , etc."
1285,1286,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,Blake Littlejohn,I gave it it 4 stars because it is super fun super awesome and fun but is kinda weird. like there is some inappropriate things. they have grand theft auto games(gta)there is inappropriate clothing and they let people get away with it. my sister read a really inappropriate thing and there's a lot of hackers it sometimes asks for privit information from you and people get there PC laptop iPad or phone hacked and you can loose your account easily so just make sure that game is not inappropriate
1286,1287,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,3,Katelyn Lol xd,"Roblox, the platform is so amazing and the games are too but whenever i try playing a popular medium graphics game on andriod, the game rather crashes and or disconnected when i have 5 bars of wifi, but on iphone it runs more smoothly, i dont know why that is but please fix it."

I hate the amount of people I have had to report and block lately because they are calling me ""freak"" and also ""6 year old"" though I am NOT and I keep finding them in that same game they were bullying me in the next day!"
1288,1289,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,4,Sean Liphart,Amazing game keep it up! And the reason i did not rate 5 stars is because there is some bugs like your moving your screen and then eventually you can only move it in an out which is sometimes annoying please fix it! Another bug is your screen freezes but its just ANNOYING i really hope you can fix it soon to make roblox a better and more fun experience!!! One more thing your playing with friends or something and it kicks you from the game and you normally have to close the app and open it again.
1289,1290,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,5,Shalima Chandrasekharan,"I love this game! the problem is, the Robux.. I don't want it to be like a dollar it is too costly for me i want it to be a little less.otherwise it's a great game! But it would be cool if u can add colours option for the shirt and all.That would be cool just giving some information on how to make the game better but it's also good."
1290,1291,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,4,FluffyPuppyGaming Fluffy,"I love it, but once again it does kick me out when I play my games.. (Most games) I love it still! Just a bit idk. counting I would love how they would make some of the stuff pretty/handsome and make them free. (For starters) counting when I'm dressing up it'll kick me out. And make some things cheap. Like making a group, like making clothing for free and let them show a tutorial instead of looking all over stuff. (videos, Google, & more) I will give a 4.5 (4-5)"
1291,1292,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,3,Alex K,"When your on phone I some times go to jump but I miss the jump button. I wish you can make it so the jump button a little more to the middle of the screen the same way an iPad is because with an iPad the jump button is closer to the middle. Also I hate the camera glitch, I mean you are a 1m dollar company and you can't even fix a simple camera glitch. But overall on computer all the controls are good. 👍"

1299,1300,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,1,Jakub Nowak,"Great game with many different options for what to play but there are a few issues. First of all, the censorship is unnecessary and useless however much it is fixed. Nearly all (or all) languages that aren't English are censored and many typos get censored plus people will always find a way to swear. Please make it optional to have censored words like among us does. Secondly, many game are low quality or clickbate copies of good games. Lastly there should be a way to play offline alone."

1320,1321,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,goku ssj god,"It's a really good game but I have two complaints: first sometimes there is a glitch where your screen gets stuck and all It does Is zoom In and out and when you walk the camera angle just goes down and you can't see anything infront of you, second: I don't really like how free Items aren't cool like the ones that cost robux like the hair and stuff I would really appreciate It If you made some cool clothes and hair or something probably even a cool face for free."
1321,1322,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,3,Nathaniel Cruz,"Well I would have to say this game is pretty fun! But there is one thing that doesn't work so there is a hug and I can't update my game for some reason. Alot of people can't really update it,and my friends say that they can't update it either so. If u can Roblox please fix the bug."
1322,1323,2022-07-14,2022,07,14,4,Anneliese Joy Greenhill-Raymond,I've tried it a few times before sometimes it takes too long to load and it's pretty awesome I really like it so like if you could like have like the capacity and some games like be a little more higher so that more people could join games cause right now I was on a call with my friend and she was in a game. I tried to join it but I couldn't.
1323,1324,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Samara WheelerBruce,"5 stars! I literally love it! I play this all the time with my friends, it has great quality, sometimes lags so that brings down a star by 1 so 4 for lagging and shutting down sometimes but I mostly play bloxburg so there may be scams but dont trust them, There are ads for ""Free Robux"" But there isn't DONT TRUST LINKS UNLESS YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEM. btw Roblox 4 stars for u :D"

It's like a roblox logo glitch like it means i can't leave or reset. But maybe it's my tablet problem soo yeahhh...But still it's the best game ever."

1326,1327,2022-07-12,2022,07,12,5,Caden Demay,Awesome game or should I say games You can play a lot of games say you like monster jam you can play it with your friends. My favorite game is Brookhaven roleplay you don't even have to earn money to buy things. Best part is that every game doesn't have ads so I really recommend it. Hoped this helped. PS: You have to go through some personal stuff when you first download it.

I do not know if anyone else is having this issue so maybe it's just an issue with my device? Either way it's still a pretty good app."

Two, there's a glitch were your screen can't move and you can only zoom in and out And one more, when I join sometimes, my character moves were my camera is facing Please fix these"

And there is Brookhaven, bloxburg,jailbreak,adopt me and 3008! These are the best games to play👌!

1330,1331,2022-06-17,2022,06,17,4,Nel Stemplewski,"I love the platform, there's so many games to choose from, you can chat with friends, make friendships, roleplay, play obbies, make different accounts and more. But there is one problem that has been bugging me. And that is that there are so many updates. It is really annoying because they normally take up loads of MB and I mean LOADS. But even though, I would really recommend this platform to anyone who asks. :)"

1333,1334,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Tori,"urm ive been hacked and scammed many times so it sorta sucks but overall roblox doesnt even seem like a game on how different it is to all the others. i would recommend it for children, and others. even adults. just be safe and careful because if you get hacked the hacker could see your location. and lastly when playing be nice to others! trust me it pays off. overall roblox is a great game! its really detailed and alot of fun thin gs to do."
1334,1335,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,5,Lindsay Height,This game is amazing! You can create a character of your choice and you can change it whenever you want too. There are lots of games to play and create. Lastly you can make lots of friends (Limit is 200) chat with them and play with them!

You can never get bored in this game because it has thousands of games inside Roblox. I just got a mystery roblox celebrity figurine and it includes an item token in which you scratch to find the code to redeem the item and in that there were also no issues. That is why I am giving this game 5 stars"

But lately idk why my roblox just keep crashing at the loading screen or when i was about to play some games- Its just stressing me out how i need to always relog in to play some games- It didn't lag or anything when i can finnaly get into the game. But the crash is just sooo annoying Its also always said ""Launching Experience"" But nothing happened if i waited- Its just keep going like that. Can it be fixed??"
1337,1338,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,5,parade,"Fun, love playing with friends. I like how thrr is multiple options for games although sometimes it can get boring easily after playing for a long time. I also think that some of the updates have ruined the game. Also having the ""robux""option encourages people to spend lots of money on roblox."
1338,1339,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Jose,It is one of the greatest games ever. Aside from some issues. One of the most common is of course lag. Whenever i lag im forced to either exit the app or the game. My second issue is that you have to pay REAL money for robux making it a pay-to-win type of game. I wish i could earn robux by completing missions or other things to earn robux. Aside from all that i thought this was a decent app.
1339,1340,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Boitumelo Majolo,Hello everyone I would like to say I love this app a lot but the problem os it kicks me out of the game when I am playing and it will load again and when you enter Roblox it takes a while for you to enter the game some of you will think it's my phone but my phone is perfectly fine with other apps and it does not kick me out pls fix the problem because I am starting to get annoyed with this 😤😠😡

The one problem is that I can't find out how to make a game.I have a Samsung galaxy tablet. Please update it or something so tablet users like me can make games and enjoy them. Also, I hate the new death sound."
1343,1344,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,2,Berto E,The game is great but every time I get on the game it kicks me out for no reason after I've been in the game for a certain time and I don't even be playing the game for a long time I'll just be in there like for like it can be 10 minutes Dad kick me out and then I have to close the app and come back in and it keep doing the same thing and I have ROBLOX right and I create my character right into a good person right and every time I come back my character is back to a noob again and I have to keep

There are 3 ""Glitches"" which literally make the game unplayable. 1: When I die more than 2 times, It makes my camera move up n down. I use left and right and it always happens when i move/stand or anything. 2: There is a move glitch where i move and see left or right after 1min of seeing there, i walk and see again but instead it moves up & down. 3:Its fixed but there is a guy name tuber, and he hacks me."
1345,1346,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,3,Katarina McPake,"This game is good but a lot of the games are rubbish and clearly the moderators are really bad cuz there are loads of toxic people, spawn campers, etc. The controls of the camera and player are abysmal and bug out frequently. And, worst of all, the devs never address these issues and clearly lie on the update logs as none of the issues they claim to have addressed actually get fixed. It was a nice concept but the devs ruined it."

I like it a lot actaully, but recently there have been MANY issues only on the PC version of the game (I use Chromebook and phone) for one, The inventory function on the Chromebook is competely broken. It does not let me drag things into the inventory hotbar and instead registers it as a click so I cannot drag, rearrange inventory, or scroll in the menu. PLEAS DEVELOPERS, FIX THIS ISSUE!"

I'm trying to re-install right now. Please fix this bug soon, This is frustrating."

So when I try to scroll to the bottom of all the classic pants I own and classic shirts I own only some show up and that's really annoying so please fix it so I can see all my classic pants and shirts thank you and please try to fix it

Sometimes it just kicks her off the game when our internet is on.3 it really disconnes my kid alot but I would recommend to play and if u could fix those giches I would put a 5/5. But it's a 3/5

Idk if it's because of my WI-FI but overall pls fix it."
1360,1361,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,kylee hencye,It is a really fun game. There are alot of different games. But the app does have a few issues for example. Sometimes the game glichs so you can't move your screen. And when you reset it doesn't work so you have to leave the game to reconnect. But that is really the only thing. Otherwise this is a great game.
1361,1362,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,corbin brewer,"I love roblox. There are some many games to play. Some games that I like to play Is obbeys and also Rp AKA Roleplays. Some Roleplays I play Is Brookhaven, Cabin Roleplay, And more. I also like to play free draw on roblox. You can draw whatever you want. But you can't scribble. If you do you can get kicked out of the sever that you were In. But the thing Is when I click a game It takes a lot of time to load. But It's fine."
1362,1363,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Loser._. Boo,"this is a really amazing app to download! I rate it a 4 because sometimes when I'm trying to update it won't let me and it reloads. Also my game freezes and when I try to move the camera it only zooms in and out but, overall GREAT app! (Edit: Unless it's my internet)"
1363,1364,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,AlejandroPlayz,"It's a good platform. You can chat and play with friends, the standard platform needs and more. Although, there is this glitch where the view camera breaks and when you try to move it just zooms in and out."
1364,1365,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,4,aunoia,"This game is really good, its a game that has multiple games inside of it. I'll give it 4 stars because some of the items are pointless but are so expensive, for example, korblox. They should add a 1000$ robux label so it can be easier to get 100,000 rubux at a time instead of using the 100$ or using somthing else. Overall the game is great, I recommend it."

1366,1367,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,3,Chad Monta A. Landoy,it's really laggy on mobile but it can hold up most games so it's fine. but there is this one feature that annoys me. the feature that makes you auto-join a server that your friend is in. please make that feature toggleable in the settings. i appreciate it if you do.

I also enjoy that you could make your character your own style, I LOVE that its like 1 game, with lots of games in it! I just wish that you didnt have to pay for robux, and also how you need to use your id or driver's license... and i hope you guys can change the second part, but i think its one of the best games to have. :)"

Please fix it, this is major and maybe the rating will go up but when there is no issue it is decent and worth downloading"
1370,1371,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,2,Wesley Binnu,"Bruh, so after the shut down it was very very very bad, however, promo codes are not used anymore and why? Although, I can't say all numbers, people were talking about the camera glitch after the shut down, I have not expected roblox to be more worse than the old ones, man I'd rather wish the shut down never happened again. Ok but I was playing this game called: VICTORY RACE, and when I walked forward, my joystick started to freeze, so I jumped, then it did something to the camera. Thanks"

If you are bored you can play this game!!!!!! Also there's a little glitch that someone when you do something and it says teleport failed the camera gets stuck. I hope you can fix it thank u!!

1373,1374,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,5,Taniyah Cash,Funny 🤣 happy 😁 weird ! There's just a lot of emotion in this app and different ones and most of them creep you out and most of them just makes you want to throw on your device at the wall and then there's one where you like a whole frame horror movies like this is just a lot of emotions! 🤣
1374,1375,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Bria,Why I give it four stars is because I dont have a lot of storage so I deleted Netflix so roblox can work. well I'm really wrong it has thousands of troubles because when I try to update it had issues it's really frustrating and I have to update it all over again I dont know if it's my phone but I definitely think its roblox dont waste your time on this if you have to update it a million of times

It's my favourite game, but there is a few problems in there, first,when i had my old account,it kicked me for some reason, there wasn't a reason why I was kicked,i really loved my old account,but now I'm happy with my new account,second,when i play a game,perhaps,adopt me when i jump sometimes i can't move, i didn't really like a new thing in there,when i press that little Roblox button so u can reset or leave it's really new,and it confuses me sometimes but i love this app,ty"

But every update it does take up some storage but everything else is great. Plus you can create your own games, pretty much you can make anything here"
1377,1378,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Skylar Smith,"This game was very fun. I started 2018, the only thing I dislike is the new ""OOF"" sound- Also,I have had many bugs, lag isn't from the game, just the kind of phone I have. You should make this game where it doesn't need WIFI to play, because this is my favorite game and I travel places and my phone doesn't have WIFI then. in all, the game is amazing! many of my friends play it, I get to make new friends too! I recommend."

1380,1381,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,craig elliott,I love the games but I don't like having to install updates every other week. If you could deliver updates less regularly that would be awesome!!!!!! Also some of the games are very laggy and don't work correctly. Other than that this is one of my favorite games and I would definitely recommend this game!
1381,1382,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Dianne Troquille,Amazing app and i 100% recommend to anyone.

1383,1384,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Pro Jack,"2023 feedback: daily rewards (such as clothing, accesories, and lastly emotes and gears). Also best game ever! But the bug is when you move the screen, it just zoom out/up, thank you if you accept this feedback! Also i enjoyed these experience! Keep up the great work."
1384,1385,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,4,Mike,"This app is great! The games are awesome! Also, i love that you can create, build, customize avatar, & more! But some things are not the best. But, i love this app, it also brings back memories from the old times. But keep up the great work! Well, also, being banned or your account terminated is not the best or funniest thing in the world. But, one of my favorite app/game so far! 👌🙉"
1385,1386,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Ella Walls,Roblox is a good game. I love that there are so many choices when it comes to picking a game. Sometimes there is a glitch where your character can't move and you can only zoom in and out. But I'm sure many people have that same problem. If you could fix that then the game would be even better. But overall great game.
1386,1387,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,pauline espena,"This is a really fantastic game on roblox even though there are some bugs in particularly in game and Problems, But more So, keep the good work! But However, Can you change the Verification because when i log out my account acciedently and i tried to get into my account. It keeps on ""Whoops That's not quite right."" When i answered all of them right! And im very annoyed. And also i dont know if its a glitch or something cause Recently i got mine back right now. 😐😑"
1387,1388,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Andrew smucker,It's a fun game and I give it five stars but I do have problem with it. Sometimes the screen glitches and I have to get off the game and lose my progress 9 out of 10 times. But it still is my favorite game I own I just hope you can fix that problem.
1388,1389,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,3,Dean Richardson,Can you fix my problem with the constant kicking out. If I play for to long on one game I can't play anything now only one game will work if I don't play another first. otherwise it will keep crashing for days. Very annoying when I'm used to play the whole day. And I can only now play for 5 seconds to 3 minutes
1389,1390,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,tea tea,"This game is very fun! You can play a lot of games with your friends, siblings etc. You can also make cute avatars with robux & without robux. But the thing is there should be another way of getting robux, since most people don't like spending money. And also some bugs, other than that the game is very fun! I suggest you to download it if you're bored or if you don't have anything to do! Tip: Playing with friends is more fun (Hopefully you guys make friends!) Stay away from the toxic ones! <3333"
1390,1391,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,Mureti Muoka,I love this game I can play with my brother and best friend ❤ but there is a slight problem most of the time the screen freezes and when you try turning your camera it only zooms in and out I'm sending this review so you can please fix it please it makes it hard to play. -all regards mureti muoka.
1391,1392,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,Foxy Roxy,"Its veeery good, kid freindly, fun and overall an amazing game, but you need to add the feature to go to settings on the xbox!!! I forgot my password and its only logged in to my xbox, I cant log into my phone and I cant check my password!! add it and I will rate it 5 stars pleeeeeeeeeease!!!!!!"
1392,1393,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,A Google user,It's a great game but there are some bugs that will need to be fixed for e.x. sometimes you can't move your camera and you can only zoom in and out. Otherwise it's a great game!! 🎮💕😁👍
1393,1394,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,jennifer blackburn,So fun i think its good for everyone bc some games are good for math and roleplaying and sometimes its so funny what ppl are doing and you can play with friends in games and that you can choose your outfit and when your new there is alot of things that are free if you dont have rubox and the game is so fun and that anyone can play the game but sometimes it takes a long time to update and someties the screen doesnt move where you want it to move but with some of the rest of the stuff is good :)
1394,1395,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Katelyn King,"I.LOVE.IT- I cant even describe i strongly recommend roblox to adventure seekers of any kind. My fave games are adopt me royale high and guess fnaf characters. But there are a few things. First, it takes a while to get in games and when I try to change my character it won't change unless its like a hour or so. Other then that I got no complaints <3"
1395,1396,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,3,Zaidyn Molton,"Great, although it takes me off games and the app itself, and it's not because my internet because it doesn't say anything like that. It just takes me off with no details. Please fix this, it's a really great game but I get frustrated when it just takes me off on about EVERY GAME! So it's not the game itself. Roblox please reply back and fix this bug. My brother has the same problem. PLEEAASE Fix this I LOVE this game"
1396,1397,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,Kenny Kinard,this is a very fun game. There are so many mini games inside of this game and i highly recomend it if you like adventure games. However there is a couple of issues like when you go to open the chat it glitches. Also the game can be extremely laggy.
1397,1398,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,3,RiftyFish,"Bro u need to fix the purchase bug. Makes it to where you can buy one set of robux any amount and then after that it says purchase could not be made. It's not just me because my younger brothers Also have the same problem. Yes they have older ""gen"" phones but I have a galaxy s 22 so I don't think it should be a problem. Maybe just an android problem but I'd like it to be fixed. It's severely frustrating. Thank you"
1398,1399,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Zahra Nuri,"I have a few problems with Roblox 1. The clothing sometimes gets blurry 2. The camera sometimes gets stuck and I have to rejoin in order to make the camera move again 3. Sometimes my data on games do NOT save 4. Even though I make the quality low it crashes SO MUCH 5. ( The new Roblox oof sounds sucks ) But other than that, the game is kinda good"
1399,1400,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Clarosa Agustin,"I love this game and it's so cool it has a many server to play and explore....But I only rate it 4 star because it's always disconnected, but the wifi has a many cignals...when it's disconnected already, my avatar turn into black or invisible.....and when I'm walking it always stop and outojump without touching the jump Botton...and it has no free robox :(....Please fix it ;("
1400,1401,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Lucie,"When it was like first put out, it was very fun. then when it's around now, there's slenders, emos, furries, blockys, headless,etc. It just isn't the same anymore. I'm starting to drift away from it as I'm heading into year 7. Sure it's still fun to hop on and just play with my friends but it gets kinda boring. I swear, it just- isn't the same as how it used to be when I was like 5 playing it in my dad's basement on his computer. And now, I'm almost 13 and using my phone. Sure there's bad abt it"
1401,1402,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,5,Ashley { RedRuby },i would say more than 5 star but theres no other option sometimes it may bug but it gets fixed quickly and easily but yeah to have fun in this you need to explore random games but i advice putting on low graphics to get smooth animation and last thing no robux well thats fine dout worry theres some free clothes and hair accesorries and all that have a great time playing with friends or alone HOPE you PLAY the ONE and ONLY ROBLOX
1402,1403,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Rebecca Adam,It's good although I have a few issues the robux is way too overpriced and everytime I'm in a game and check everyone's name on the like menu thing or whatever its called after I leave it like that for a bit and exit out of it and resume the game when I walk I can't move my screen I can only walk idk if its only happening to me or its happening to people but starts differently but pls fix this overall the game is excellent!

1404,1405,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,Isabella,"Its very cool, I love this game. There's only some little bugs, when you report someone it doesn't work, and there's a lot of bullying there's people calling other people ugly names and other stuff but other then that its a very fun game, but I really wish you could fix the reporting thing. Also if there Age's are 4 or 5 you should put the games you think there for there age."
1405,1406,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Lucyruby45 2017,Great app! Love the selection of games and the avatar items! But i only have one problem with catalog/avatar. With the 2022 layered clothing i would love it if the clothes would fit on any body type and makd it so it doesnt look so chunky! Other than that awsome game!😊
1406,1407,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,MinerPlayz [GD],"A lot of bugs to be fixed, not sure if not being able to jump while swimming is another bug, but it sure is annoying. Still, a lot of talented developers always drags me back into playing this game again."
1407,1408,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Dahi157 Pancho,Apart from it being online and having to have Internet while playing roblox its a interesting game especially how it is multiplayer and has more than one game in it. (*´∀`*). But like everyone else is saying the bugs need to be fixed its still a great game though.
1408,1409,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,Niña Zarrina Villarmino,I really love playing the game! The games are honestly really fun and competitive. I love how there are different topics for the best you might want to play so they're all sorted out. But I have encountered some glitches/lags in some games.
1409,1410,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,3,Principal Of the thing,"Love this game but I'm always having problems with the catalog, whenever I would try to make a new avatar suddenly half my clothes are gone, my clothes wouldn't log in or it would just tell me ""no items found"". Please fix this problem, I cannot deal with having to refresh it every time just for it to continue telling me that."
1410,1411,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,Khaled Ayoub,"It's an excellent app! 👌 it's really helpful when I'm bored!I like it were you can make friends,Rp,games,groups And much more! A little glitch but it's OK! I like it how it doesn't need ads it's very calming And the avatars Definitely 5 starts. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"
1411,1412,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,3,natalie shugars,"It's pretty good for when I'm bored, but it's not my favorite game there are a lot of options and I definitely recommend for people of all ages and might be a child's game, but it's a pretty fun child's game. You can choose between obies or obstacle games, horror games, and even more I definitely recommend this game."
1412,1413,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Evie Rose,I love Roblox it's really fun! But it is addictive and can be quite frustrating. It is really interesting and some games have private servers. Personally I think it is best to only friend people you know but it's your choice. Hope this is helpful! :)
1413,1414,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,kaylan young,This is such a cool game! it does lag a lot and it takes up a lot of starage. The problem is if you have an old computer and they bombard it with updates your disk storage runs out.
1414,1415,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Jack Dertien,"Roblox is a favorite game of mine that I play on mobile and people say there are glitches and they happen to me, but I do not let them get the best of me. I would like it if the creator could make the pause button smaller because I sometimes hit it and it pops up in front of my screen. I do give this app a 5/5."
1415,1416,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,Nwabisa Mafu,"I really love this app and I love all the different games.The reason why I gave it four stars is beacause every time I play a game it glitches and that bothers me.Sometimes I have to reset my character or leave the game, sometimes reseting my character doesn't work and if I leave the game my progress will be lost but other than that the app is really good but please fix the problems"
1416,1417,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,5,Taylor Robinson,"Ok. If u asked why I put 2 stars here's why. I used to LOVE roblox. It was very fun. It had almost no problem except lag and stuff. I played this game almost everyday, until today. It working like normal until I left for a while and got back on. I joined a game and I thought it was normal until I moved my screen. When I wanted go down it went up, and when I wanted to go up it went down. It has never been like this. It was like this in every game. Making it unplayable. Please try to fix it? :)"
1417,1418,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,3,Bernadette Guerrero,"This game is great but there are some things that need to be changed. I don't like how it kicks you from a game. And looking for new clothes for my avatar. If there is one super tiny hat it will cost like 2,000 robux. And one last thing is that i like how the tags are there if anyone says bad words but i think they should take out the tags when its just numbers. Thank you"
1418,1419,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Das Thangavelu,"Yoo sooooo gud game, like the graphics are rilly cool,*in most games*, and gameplay rilly rilly gud, but the reason for 4 stars not 5 cuz when u first join the game the keyboard wasd control dont sync with the character movement, like if i press w, it will move forward after 1 second And i hav no idea by how much it will go forward,(for pc this happens, probably cause of lag)"

1422,1423,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,1,Stacy Sopcek,It's a good game but can you make it were as you jump it doesn't move your screen please? It is very annoying because if you accidentally tap the roblox icon in the top of your screen when you move it either makes it were you can only zoom in and out or when you move it makes your screen go underneath your character mid-walking. Thank You! :) I logged out and cant get back in.. i tried and tried but i did the verification and still i couldn't get in.. Please fix this i feel like im crying

You are only allowed to equip 1 hair and thats it and I literally bought 2 pieces of hair that I think looks good together on my avatar .. A total waste of my robux AND my money unless they make more hairs accessable again. This is what the error said: ""Failed to save: A maximum of 1 Hair Accessories is allowed."" PLEASE remove this and let us be creative with access to any hair style again and not allow us to only have 1 hair equipped, thank you."

Maybe turn this game into a 60 fps game! (Edited months later) and now my jump button isn't working. Why does the jump button size has to be the same as your device size?"
1427,1428,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Dala Vang,"I really like this game. It has alot of characters, games, and etc. Many different kinds of clothing, hats, and games. I play this everyday You can change your avatar to many different kinds of characters! Its more fun if you play with siblings or friends, etc."
1428,1429,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,James Malone,"This is a really fun game but there is three problems with it in my opinion first, online dating it's not only dangerous but it's not supposed to happen it's mostly in Brookhaven two, online bullies it hurts more then you think like people make fun of adopt me players and say ""it's a baby game"" three,the bug where you screen glitches and can't move your screen it's anoying and even if you reset your character it's still suck overall it's a great game if your reading this watch for these things"

1432,1433,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Kira Davidson,"So so fun. All of my friends love this game! But the annoying things are lagging, my screen randomly turns black and I have to exit the game and rejoin whatever I was playing, and toxic people. Curse words sometimes don't tag out so people are finding ways to swear in-game. Therefore whenever I play something with a younger person, they witness it. Otherwise a lovely game. Oh, and the robux is SUPER expensive. Anyway such a cool game 🎮"
1433,1434,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,1,Kaylee,"Hey sorry! Here are my reasons why I put one star, You guys really have to get hackers in check. I also had problems with my Google account sign in. I had the right user and password, but it kept kicking me out, and it put me in a loop of signing in. (This happened after the big crash when like no one could play) The majority of the games are horrible, and I only used to play 4. It also brought down my battery a bunch. In general it got kinda boring. I don't reccomend. Never getting again."
1434,1435,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Hanji,"I love this game!! It's great and all , but the one thing i hate is that it's very laggy on tab . The other thing is that you need money to buy robux. I think it should be like the better you are at playing the more money you get. Anyways it's a great game. One last thing is that the game takes up way too much space when you update it. It's the worst deleting all your photos."
1435,1436,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Your mother,"This game is pretty awesome I don't really have any problems and there is such a variety of games to play! I have one complaint though... I'm trying to update the game, it keeps making me delete apps. Everytime I update it I have to delete and app then it ends up not letting me update still. I've done this many times yet it still won't update."

Theres no adds and its family friendly!!!....It gives you the opportunity to let your imagination flow.

The old games (such as simulators and tycoons) aren't being played as much anymore. And for example my friends don't want to play with me and all they want to do is something else. I recommend maybe getting people to want to play them more? But the actual game is amazing, and I definatly recommend.😆🤩😍❤"

The game does have it cons but it has mant many pros. The games are usually appropriate for ages 6 and over. I would give it a 5 but i do not it has what a parent would think if there kid played this game. Or what the player would expect."
1440,1441,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,saadatu ahmed,It's cool it's just that it's just sometimes hook and you can't do it again like when I first downloaded the game it worked perfectly well after sometimes it didn't work again he was always saying that I should upgrade upgrade upgrade and when I upgrade it will not still work
1441,1442,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Steven Wood,"Its an awesome game but there is some stuff they could fix. For example, we all know that it's a kids game but sometimes they would tag words that aren't even bad. I MEAN, HOW IS ""OK"", AND ""IM"", BAD? People also try to rip you off with some of the clothing catolog. Like one T shirt will cost 999999999 robux. THERE'S NO WAY A SINGLE IMAGE ON A CHARACTER SHOULD COST THAT MUCH. Other than that, this is possibly the best game I've ever played. And I reccomend that you should try it out yourself."
1442,1443,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Pasbal Lolo,"What a nice game. I rated it 3 stars because if you're on mobile, camera always glitches and to fix it you need to rejoin the game which is annoying especially when you're playing tycoon that has no saving. I noticed a bug a while ago which I can't see any chats or any letters. arthurisnery on roblox"
1443,1444,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,5,Megan Summers,"Very good now. Lots of bugs are fixed and new clothes. This is probably my favorite online game and it has 0 ADS! There's one bug tho, On mobile the joystick will often move on its own so I'd have to go to the menu but sometimes it would lock my screen. And when I'm on my other account I can't get it to stop making my avatar to face 1 direction, this is annoying when I'm trying to make a character, I tried going to settings and mess with stuff but it didn't work. Overall it's a very good game👍"
1444,1445,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Marsela Espinoza,I love the app I can make new friends and have fun but the reason I gave the app a 3 star is because people are very toxic on their and they do very bad things and whenever I go by a thin paper bush I start lagging and it gets very annoying and the new hats you give out are only there for 24 hours and I find it very unfair because the people who want the new hats can never get them because of school and etc.So if you would or can please make the hats stay for at least 2 days and fix the problem
1445,1446,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,3,Dr. Bright,"So, first things first. The Roblox updates are MASSIVE. I'm playing on mobile and every time I update, I have to delete like seven games for it to work, and not only that, I'll delete games and it starts to download, but then tells me I need to delete MORE. Because of this, I've deleted my entire phone gallery just to update this game. Second, what's up with the camera randomly locking up on mobile? It's horrid. This game is overall great but still has massive problems that need to be resolved."
1446,1447,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Kameren,"This game is so fun! You get to play thousands of worlds and you can even create some of ur own! Tho on some electrics the game can be very laggy and hard to play, there's absolutely no adds, And you get to play with ur friends. There is one more problem with the game, which is that whenever it gets updated and I go to the play store to update it it says that I need to delete some of my others apps for it to be updated, tho when this happens I just uninstall the app then I renstall it."
1447,1448,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,2,Veronica !,"The game itself is great but there's this repeating problem, whenever I log out of my account and try logging into it or an alt account again it keeps saying my password is incorrect even though it's correct. I don't know why this keeps happening but please, fix this immediately as it could be a huge problem towards other people too, I have to constantly reset my password and re install the app just for it to let me log in and that's just not it."
1448,1449,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,5,Nelly The Elephant,Sooooooo fun! No ads and I love playing online and making friends ( my favourite is adopt me) the only thing wrong is that you have to pay money for robux it would be better if you could earn robux doing tasks or something. I also need to update it every week and it gets really annoying it doesnt even fix all the bugs i have! >:( still it's a good game :3
1449,1450,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,5,Rosemarie Martinez,"It's a really good app n I really enjoy it sm, but there r just some problems I have when it comes to mobile. 1, my game lags when I play the game for too long. 2, alot of people have this kind of glitch on mobile which is the zoom in or out glitch, I've experienced it so many times and I really recommend for Roblox to fix it bc it gets really annoying and u have to leave the game just to fix it. Anyways the app is really good so I give it a 5 stars."
1450,1451,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,Jacob Smith,GOOD APP! VERY COOL. But there are some mistakes like it being down from time to time severs crashing and stuff like that. But other then that its amazing! One thing they should add is roblox studio for MOBLIE! THAT WOULD BE TRUELY AMAZING!!
1451,1452,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,5,Cløudy Cãt,"I love roblox! Its a really easy way to make friends and an easy way to plat with your irl friends if your bored! The different ways you an change your avatar on your roblox person is great! But sometimes roblox lags and it will do that for days on end. Another problem is the people, yes, its themsevls that are doing that but it sucks. Please fix that."
1452,1453,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Amany Mohamed,Wow!!!! This game is awesome!!! I love it it's the best game ever that I have more friends so I am not bored of this game anymore!!!!!!!!! It's an awesome game!!!!!! 😃😃😃👍🥰🥰but.. it always need to be fixed.when I move my character it freezes for 5 sec and sometimes it shakes and do something strange it's great but a little weird
1453,1454,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Saira Adil,The game is amazing and fun. You can play with friends.. play different experiences and many more. However I think the limited faces should be less robux.. but still a great game!
1454,1455,2022-07-16,2022,07,16,4,M a r,"Really great game, lots of experiences to well experience. But the only issue I have with the game is the amounts of bugs, such as when you accidentally click menu on mobile, you either can't move your camera or the camera moves when you use the walking controls, if these bugs were to be fixed the game would be more enjoyable."
1455,1456,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,2,Valters Vanags,"It keeps crashing my game for no reason like when I even try going in the app it either will crash or not but when I try joining a game my game crashes and shows a screen ""Launching experience"" that's why I'm rating 2 starts cuz of it"
1456,1457,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Techniques with Aj Beatz,"This is a very fun game, Very addicting, But there's many bugs on mobile, What I'm focused on you fixing is camera bugs, I would rate 5, But I have to play on computer because of this, It may be easier on computer, But it's also fun on mobile, So can you please add more mobile support? It would be very helpful, Overall I probably do give this a 5 star 🌟, But got now 4 until we get more mobile support."
1457,1458,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Scott Dunn,It is one of the best games I've ever played but sometimes there's lags or disconnected issues or when there's an update it takes almost forever Also on a tablet the connection stinks. Please try to fix this because P.S its great except those 4 issues P.S.S sometimes the upgrades don't really work!!!!
1458,1459,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,favorits yay,"It's a littel hard walking for beginners so to learn to walk in a straight line I recommend playing a waterpark game then once you can walk straight try playing tower of fun its like tower of hell but with checkpoints then just try and explore! (Ex: adopt me, tower of fun, brookhaven, jailbreak and many more)"
1459,1460,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,Timothy Gunn,"Well, these game is really fun Ive played this when I was a kid in still do 😂😂 this game have good graphics great games like game within game's kinda like arcade games it's the best, shooting, horror, roleplay, everything in one, that's crazy and I love and I hope u can take the time to recognize this beautiful creation of a game it really is. thank u 🔥🔥❤️❤️"
1460,1461,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,ClappingNerds,"This game sucks they change everything the controls are completely bad, the joystick stick in the game are the same so whats the point of making two of the them?? The old one was 5x better than this and the sensitvity is insane level for mobile or tablets."
1461,1462,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,1,Chael playz_980,"I'm almost about to quit this is going to be the last time, first you removed the oof sound second you never even get to update this game which can cause a lot of bugs instead, you always go events except for updates, third you made me disconnect every 30 seconds. Fix this bug."
1462,1463,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Debat Abeng,This game must be fix if I play this game in like 5 minutes all of my screen go black and I cannot play again. Second the screen game is freezing when I accidentally pressed the setting button. Third when I was walking in the game and accidentally pressed the settings button it look normal to me but when I walked my walking control the camera
1463,1464,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,sarah moylan,"I love this game! But the robux is overpriced. 10,000 would be 100£. But thers one bug that I hate. The camera bug. If I was walking it would just stop! It's just sooooooooooo annoying!!!!!! Who ever owns this company can u just pls fix it! Once I was playing and it glitched so much that I had to make a new account. It was so annoying! Plas fix that too. So I give it four stars"
1464,1465,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,1,Totally Mxrtal,"I'd like the everything about this, however i really want you guys to add a tab or maybe a system where it shows how many players in total were in the server and you can go back to all the way to when the player joins in the server for the first time. I'd like it if you add a search bar where you type in the the date and see what you've played and look at the people in the server, the total amount since i had someone i really wanted to friend, for the game to update and losing connection."
1465,1466,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,Chloe Bear,i love it but a lot of things are really pricey i mean the game is a money spender and you can waste it fast for a couple of items. I think the stuff in roblox should cost the same prices as stuff in stores because you are spending money in both thing 1. getting robux 2. spending it . my point is that a face shouldn't have to be over 100k robux . the prices are stupid and i think they should be smaller instead of over 4k besides you pay a lot of money for less because of the prices.
1466,1467,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,5,Aadrianna Chastain,It's the best you get multiple choices of games from obbys fighting and racing and more you can talk to people make friends and add people it's really fun and plus you get make your own name and avatar and you can have a nickname it's the best game download it and see how much your like it. It's the best game and even my grandma plays it she loves it too so it's for kids and grown ups
1467,1468,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Mahad Abdullahi,"The game is great! But there is many glitches like joystick glitch, making so when I move it continuously stops moving especially in racing games, so plz fix that! and again it's extremely great I love it"
1468,1469,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,4,Angel alpha6,I love this game but it only has some problem that we all hope u can fix i will describe it on the games ive played so far like pet sim when i join and i clicked skip or not there's a black square sometimes it didn't and second (this is for all games) is within few minutes or hours when i move the screen it can't move it zooms in or out and when i rejoin the game it happens again pls fix this bug im not hating it but i just want this bug to disappear and roblox would improve for better rates
1469,1470,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,cjbwink,"I love Roblox it's definitely one of my FAVORITE games, but there's a few bugs that made me give it 4 stars. I think it's pretty ridiculous that Roblox gets rid of our clothing, I had pants and Roblox got rid of them, why should we pay for them if your just gonna get rid of them? At least can I get my robux back? There are some games that the screen glitches, like I can only zoom in and out. Over all, I really like playing Roblox it's an amazing game and I love all of the games. Great game!"
1470,1471,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Patrice Nadeau,"This is a amazing game with billions of games to explore you can chat with friends and play your favorite games you can even make friends, build your own game and make your avatar there's so many games and so many more to come like tycoons, obbys, story's, last to survive, roleplay and so much more and in my opinion the best game ever!"
1471,1472,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Riley Elizabeth,"Okay the app has me constantly upgrading it. tired of it every time I go to do something on it it says Roblox is not running correctly because you have to upgrade. it I'm sick and tired of it I don't know what to do with it. can you please fix these bug issues? I will give it a 4 rating,"
1472,1473,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,3,Hazel,"The game consumes too much battery. Example I played the game for 1 and a half hour and it consumed 30-40% battery. While I was charging my battery doesn't increase, instead it decreases. I don't know how to fix this. Please fix this I really hate it, I can't play roblox for too long."
1473,1474,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,5,Nicole Olivares,It's a great game but there are two problems.1. Sometimes I try jumping and it doesn't let me as if I didn't press the jump button.2. It lags a LOT like Sometimes I'm playing with my friend in a game they're driving on their phone it show that they're at the place they want to be then when look at my screen we are still driving
1474,1475,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,5,Ethan Cele,WHAT AN AMAZING GANE to play with your friends and many more connect and make new friends build and explore so many I definitely recommend it for children I love this game so creative and beautiful it even have its own currency how amazing this will become one of the best game I know!! Enjoy your experience.
1475,1476,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,Tyson Benedict,"This game is great, and I don't really have a problem with it, but I still don't really think its worthy of five stars. Something that I think would be a great addition to the game, is a comment area for each game so the creator can fix some bugs, or maybe add some things to the game."
1476,1477,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Emily Dufek,This game is really fun there are lots of game to choose that are tycoons roleplays it's just so much fun it's really for kids. There are a few people the trick you. But I would not worry. It's good for boys and girls. You can even make your own game. It's just really fun I recommend ☺
1477,1478,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,3,Vilma Ratkeviciute,"I love the game and all we need is a unlimited amount of friends and then the game would be better. I love it, but at the same time, im just chatting with friends, and then I cannot say boosh, kill, etc. I hate it when it actually tags out when you dont even say something wrong? I dont have safe chat either?? Edit: New glitch. Shift lock is always enabled after turning it on once. Im pretty sure it is for both PC and mobile."
1478,1479,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Calixy Ary,"Love it cuz it has many games to play and you can have friends and the community got a lil toxic but its all In good hand love your game also Im using a phone and when I open the menu when I'm running it makes my screen freeze, make it move on its own (when I run) or just zoom in and out pls fix this glitch the only way to fix it is by rejoining I think this also happens on pc pls fix, when I rejoin I don't join same server can't join any1 cuz I have max friends and if i like the server fix pls."
1479,1480,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Mika,"i love this gsme tbh theres a bunch of fun things to do on here and a great way to make friends aswell. i also grew up on this app and i absolutely love it but i dont like most of the new changes. And i dont like how we have to have to prove our age for vc most 13 year olds dont have or an id or driving license or possibly a passport, but over all the game is great u should play it (ill fix my grammar mistakes later)"
1480,1481,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,1,Kevo Kin,"It's okay it needs a lag stopper, and I've played this game for 6 years and the lag problem still exists I might quit the game it's not fun anymore it's just copy and paste at this point as the game won't let me play anything I join a game and it doesn't work it legit is a problem you all need to fix if your game is not fully functional it shouldn't be up"
1481,1482,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Valerie,I'm giving this game a 5 star because it's just a very well made game. Now I have been looking through the comments and I can somewhat relate because I do play on phone but most of the time computer. But I do find when roblox updates they try to fix these problems. I also have been playing this game for years now so I hope this review was helpful.
1482,1483,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,3,Alliahplayz 30,"Good game, but I would rate it a 5 if these bugs/glitchs would get fixed, first bug/glitch : When I would join my friends or join a game it would kick me out of the app , second bug/glitch : When I would join a game it would take forever to load, third bug/glitch : The camera always freezes I can't move it to the left or right, please fix these and I would rate it 5."
1483,1484,2022-07-16,2022,07,16,5,Shabana Ahmad,"Great Game! Just a few Glitches and Bugs, sometimes in games u are in the middle of the game and when u try to move the screen it doesn't, and sometimes it's games that if we leave we can't start from there u hv to start all over, everything other in Roblox is just awesome! I recommend..!"
1484,1485,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Xavier Giffen,"It's very fun I've been having loads of fun on brookhaven,etc,etc although there are glitches where when I look it will zoom but otherwise great!Also there's not a option where you choose what region u play with so I end up with people that don't speak English nd I don't understand them (obviously)"
1485,1486,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,3,BlackPanther Kitty,"Ok, so really great up to here. I know I m writing this on my mobile but my problem is on the computer. It's that Roblox now has the mobile version on the computer and I really don't like it, it's annoying and doesn't fit well on it, so it would great if it stayed the same as before. This is why I am rating it 3 stars, you guys will get your 5 stars back if you fix it because I know alot of other people don't like this update or whatever this is meant to be. Please fix it. Thanks 👍🙂"
1486,1487,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,terry haman,This game is great in 2017 I loved playing it there is just one problem though whenever I walk in the game sometimes makes the screen go up down. In and out and its really weird so then I rejoin but then I can't move I hope this bug gets fixed! Everything else is amazing abt this game i hope it updates soon!
1487,1488,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Hank Gizzetto,"This is a absolutely great game! You can chat with your friends and play a multitude of games, all while having one app. Edit: I have also experienced the bug involving a screen lock, and I believe that roblox is not to blame. You see, if you connect a keyboard to a phone using Roblox then it considers you to be playing with the keyboard, thus activating ""PC Mode"" which can sometimes glitch and consider you to be playing on PC, without the keyboard. Additionally, the scroll wheel on PC zooms in."
1488,1489,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Kaicyn Yocum,"I really like this game because you can play tons of games like Brookhaven, piggy, demon blade and so many more and even better you can play with your friends and make friends but the only thing wrong is the glitch where sometimes when you need to move your angle but it just let's you zoom in and out but all you have to do is leave and rejoin over all GREAT game"
1489,1490,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Alice Baker,This game has other cool game inside of an game there game you have to use your mind to figure things out and have to be creative but the thing that needs to be fixed is the parental controls if you don't remember or the hacker made one how you going to change it cause then they have complete control over your account so y'all need to make it where you can change the password and the pin by email or phone number. That would make it easier.
1490,1491,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,18 Maryah Mohammad,"It's a game and Inside it is lots of games , choices are ENDLESS , you can play , Customize , trade , buy , chat , make new friends! Also don't fall for the free robux scam they are all fake guys . But recommended! , Also Roblox can u fix this glitch of the frozen screen in mobile , it's getting annoying , otherwise it's good, also please fix your moderation it kinda sucks."
1491,1492,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,3,Danielle Pennick,"I really like this game, but the same thing with me is happening to other users. Such as, your camera go's down to your feet when you walk. And you have a stuck screen, you can't look around. Making you rejoin the game to play it normally, Please fix the bugs! It would help! I did nothing bad..I think....i read your rules? I was helping someone from this person following them and the person was spamming ""SCAMMER"" and they might have reported me. I was trying to stop the argument?? 🤔 (Yesterday)"
1492,1493,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Kaylee Dancing Diva,Great game to play with friends and I love roleplaying and has lots of it. If you like having a lot of different options of games this is the game for you. There is no ads. It is not inappropriate.i do get disconnected a lot and my wifi isn't good when I play but everything else is absolutely perfect Good for kids and even adults have fun!
1493,1494,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Olly Leachman,It's an amazing game but sometimes there's a item that costs way to much like thousands to much. Also they should make a feature of that if you buy summin you don't like any more you can sell it for atleatst %75 + profit depending on how expensive the item was. But overall an absolutely ground breaking game but it does need some more features.
1494,1495,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Millie Mason,This is the most amazing game ever please please please download but only one thing I would change is the prices of stuff and sometimes if you join a random game it freezes up so please fix that like you can have amazing internet and it still doesn't work but that's basically all the rest of the game is fantastic and I love it!!
1495,1496,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,May Terrell,"Amazing game,the graphics are nice the wide choice of games,you may ask why I didn't give it five stars, well all mobile players have certain bugs which effects the playing,like the screen freezing, the screen only moving in and out, the joy stick not working,please fix this and I will update my review!"
1496,1497,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Marija Simovic,"It's the best game I've ever played but it sucks that you can't play it without internet. it would have been better if you could play without internet but with friends. It's also sucks that I can't enter to play bc it asks me to upgrade but when I want to i mean when it sends me to Google app store then it just says ""uninstall"" or ""play"" and it does not say ""upgrade"".but it's still good but it also sucks.Like broken but still good👍"
1497,1498,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Rina,"well my experience WAS great and I have made many friends. however, many people can hurt you and ya. also, for some reason I cannot log onto my account which is really annoying and ya. In conclusion, it's a very fun game which can lag but I would recommend, and I think you should give free robux it's a very annoying when you don't have any and you are not allowed to buy it on the first place. 😁+😭+😤"
1498,1499,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,taneesha ahmed,"This game was excellent and I made alot of friends. Sadly, the game has logged somepeople out(including me) and is not logging you back in with the correct details of your user and password.Other than a slight few problems,overall,it has been one of the best experience with games. You can also play with friends that you know by friend requesting people and the best part of the app is socializing!"
1499,1500,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Steve Laughton,"Roblox is a fun game with many games to choose from! I would recommend but i have come across a bug where everthing on my screen would glow bright colours or go neon blue. Also some on some games everything goes rlly glitchy (buttons, chat, words etc) please fix this! Apart from that great game and would totally recommend for all players."
1500,1501,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,WoLF .S,"I love the game a lot! it's super fun to play in my free time, and it has lots of games to choose from! but it dose have a online bully problem, but I found the best way to ignore them is either turn of chat or block them. it also lags a lot on my phone too, maybe it's me? any ways i still love this game and highly recommend it for at least 10+ in my opinion"
1501,1502,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,Krizza Oliveria,This game is so GOOD I've been playing this for 3 years but there is some bugs that need to be fix..bug (1) The screen is getting stuck and I can't rotate bug (2) it move by itself and sometimes jump bug (3) it's about the screen again sometimes I can't control it so I need to rejoin just to fix it.
1502,1503,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,Tarley,This game is fun. But sometimes my game glitches and I can't look around and it is frozen. I have to refresh it and then the hole game restarts. I find this really annoying. So old fix this. Overall the game is fun. I also bought Robux but I didn't get any😱. So umm fix everything...😁
1503,1504,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,RedWolfPlays 594,"I love it, I've been playing it for years! However, they need to stop updating so much my storage space can't handle it, plus I need room for other apps too, and I can't play on my computer because it's too hard, and some people can't afford another device too play this on. Roblox needs too think about people's storage a little more."
1504,1505,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Amiera Wilson,"I think that it is a really great game for me and other people to play it , it is fun , enjoyable but Brookhaven is starting to become really boring and I think they need to change a few things about it . The one thing I really hate about it is that it when you have to update the game,I think there is no problem with the update thing so yeah and Roblox please please fix Brookhaven because maybe a lot of people are getting sick and tired of the so known as Brookhaven."
1505,1506,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,Morgan Somers,I love it. What I think let your kids play but tell them to be careful because there's some adults on there. But it's still ok because they aren't on there the most of the time.

1506,1507,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Matt Cloutier,"Hello! uh-so,about roblox, why i give it a 5 is because...I LOVE IT OFC! but,i need help, can you PLEASE fix the bug thats in- all games sadly, whenever i lag and it freezes for a sec, it basicly makes my screen stuck and i have to rejoin or leave. But in warrior cats, its fine! and that whenever i use my keyboard for a lil it only zooms out and wont move the screen.. can you tell the mods to fix the bugs? thanks!"
1507,1508,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,2,Oxygen,"Hey, so since stock is going down ever since you started promoting and forcing rthro, I think the best thing to do is not remove r6, and stop forcing rthro. Majority of players don't even like it, or even use it. You're basically wasting time and money promoting what has been a lost cause for a long time. Avatar customization options should be expanded, not rthro related, but adding new categories for accessories, being able to wear more accessories (when not on pc) ect."
1508,1509,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Ilihia Tehani,"Roblox is a really fun, there are many games of all genres. Even if it is a bit laggy time to time its still really, really fun. There are a couple of problems though, shift lock doesn't work on chrombook. And another problem is when I go into first person or play an first person only game when I move my cursor it gets stuck or when I move when I reach the top it won't let me move my camera.(For chromebook) But other than that its really fun game. - 4 stars :D"
1509,1510,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,4,Diana Keymolent,It's a good game but one thing that annoys me most of the time are the updates and how long it takes to update the app which is annoying.something else that needs to really be looked into are the bugs in the games and the camera glitches.overall all the bugs and updates the game is really good.
1510,1511,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,Cindy J,"Awesome game I love it and all the games you can play are amazing I have it on mobile and on my computer (Issues) →→ On mobile: glitchy, slow, hard to play, a bit frustrating from time to time. On pc: pretty much fine, sometimes a bit slow, but overall amazing."
1511,1512,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Mark Mahon,"It's a very fun game for kids and other ages, I would recommend playing this if you are bored. Although it does need some updating with the mobile support alot, Most of the time it makes me go in menu for a split second then I can't move my screen, Hope you update that soon!"
1512,1513,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Lara El hihy,"I love this game.. But. There's a HUGE problem. First, the Oof sound was INCREDIBLY amazing. But when they removed it i almost cried. It had SO many memories.. Second, the R6 avatar. I heard it will get deleted or whatever on the catalog and obbys. It had more memories. Third, the chat filter. I've been playing this game for almost 3 years and today me and my friend couldn't chat so we played another game and the same happened we both tried a different game and still, nope. Please fix these."
1513,1514,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,3,Hanna Starcher,"I love playing roblox, and have since I was like 12. Now there's a bug on the app where I can't look in any directions. I can walk front and backwards, however I can't change directions or look around at all. Very unfortunate, as walking is required to play the games."
1514,1515,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Echo _XD,"This has been the best game I've ever played, You can explore and play a bunch on games and meet new friends! I've had some good experienced in the app. It's really interesting and fun! Some things should need to be fixed, Remove the crosswood game(s)"
1515,1516,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Moon_Broady97,"It's a bit laggy on my chromebook but I understand the reasoning for it. It is very fun to play on my smart phone because there are endless amounts of creativity put into the games put on roblox that people have taken the time to create. They are all very unique and thats the thing I love most about this app. You can make your visions into a ""reality"" that real people can come visit and appreciate."
1516,1517,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,crazy diffrent,I would rate this ten if i could so my friends told me to check it out and i dident think it was gonaa be a game i would be interested in so I tried it and it's the best! There's so many games and genres and you can learn a lot of things even things you don't get teached in school.i really would recommend it. And it's safe! Even tho it could be extremely laggy and glitchy it's still amazing 🤩
1517,1518,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Clarisse Gaile Chan,"There's alot of games to play here. My problems are lag in some of the games, Private servers need to get paid every month.. I really recommend playing on a tablet/iPad or Pc/laptop so that there would be higher graphics, and fps (depends if you have a good wifi too). Overall It's a fun and nice game to play with friends, or make friends."
1518,1519,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,jessica LaMere,This game is really good amd I love the fetures and the updates! One problem... When I'm on my Chromebook the chats arn't showing up when someone is talking and when I try to turn my sound off or on The icon in the corner isn't showing up and it really make me mad. I want it fixed so I can have a better time playing with my frineds and enjoy myself.
1519,1520,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,3,J Brock,"It's a great game I had played it for years now, but one problem is I started to have bad ping spikes often. Like out of nowhere it started to have often ping spikes. I don't know if it's my pc or the game. But if it's the game please fix this if you can."

But except that, it's fine!! But sometimes, the catalog is very laggy, and when I'm playing a game and I plug my charger in, it immediately closes the app! What's up with that? That's all the faults I have. Overall, it's a fine game. Just need to fix bugs."
1521,1522,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Kristina Lepird,"This game is amazing!!! You can play whatever you want parkour games, (which I'm not really good at) rpgs, any game you like it's free (except for bloxburg it cost robux, Robux are the currency in the game) you can have any outfit but they might just cost robux... But you can't do numbers so you can't teach anybody or anything the worst part about it so please fix that and all the complaints thank you! otherwise it's the best game ever 👍🏻 (I wanted to do a four and a half)"
1522,1523,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Kevin Larkins,"Good game but what is wrong with the UI Glitches?! one time every button except the usual top bar disappeared, I could move but there was no thumb pad- I could only swipe the screen, but this also moved where I was looking. I was really enjoying myself until this, and this isnt the only time something like this has happened."

Right now roblox is the main way me and my friends talk to each other. premium is also really good too. There's a bit of bugs where it say ""click this to add friends"" even tho I have friends, but it usually fixes after a few seconds"
1524,1525,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,3,Bethany Smith,I only get to play for 5 minutes until the grey screen with the launching experience comes on and kicks me out of the game. There is a particular game that kicks me out immediately after joining the server. My screen freezes up and even if I press any buttons nothing works. When I try to walk or jump it keeps doing it after I hit it once. Also it is very glitchy my screen was cut into triangles and no my screen is not cracked. I can barely play a game besides a few without being kicked out.
1525,1526,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,BriannA EDler,This is a great platform. But the bugs have to go. The joystick freezes and so does the camera making game play impossible. Not able to turn the camera or zoom in/out is getting frustrating
1526,1527,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Tasha Jerome,"I've played Roblox for a while and in my opinion it is one of the best games ever, most of the games and cosmetics are free, but you don't need to pay to have fun. Though if you have a fire fox device most of the time the game lags, other than that it's fine. One thing I would like would probably be more free items or maybe better access to create more games."
1527,1528,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,Mariana Berg,This is a great game I play every day but there sone things u should fix. One the screen is always turning of and on. Second the game has been super glitchy. third the game is super cool keep up the work and not to many updates but some. Fourth when I do updates it takes for ekes me do it again. THIS GAME IS VEING STUPID

It's actually a super fun game and I like the fact that there are constant additions to game selections and so many categories to choose from. I especially Love love LOVE the fact that the 3 of us are able to sit side by side, with each of our characters playing all the different games TOGETHER in real time. Only complaint is that the app will constantly force close"
1529,1530,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Naya Karout,"This game is amazing! But there's 3 proplems. The first problem is when I'm playing a game the screen suddenly freezes for 5 seconds then it won't let me turn the screen, then it starts zooming in and out 2nd problem is when I leave adopt me or brookhaven I need to restart my whole phone, and there's A LOT of tags for no reason?!"
1530,1531,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,CloudyX Dayz,"Roblox is not one of the regular games you buy and is fulled with many choices of games to pick from and being able to buy things for your avator and being able to pick from a variety of games and you can make your own games. The reason why can't give a full 5 stars is the lack of connection it sometimes gets and why some of the games will randomly disconnect. To be honest, this is a fun game overall and just has some connection promblems but for the most part this game is pretty fun. -Cloudy"
1531,1532,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Ellie Wirth,"I love roblox. I've been playing it for years. I never get board. It works slow and glitchs sometimes but besides that its amazing.

1534,1535,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Justicyline,"So, I absolutely LOVE this game. It's beautifully made, the games are fun, people are nice, etc. There are problems though. 1) I play this all the time; however it doesn't let you chat or see the chats from other people in-game on Xbox One. Plus, even though it's cross-platform, you cannot get into some story games. This is it, great game! Wish they bought the sound though."

Also Roblox is great because of all the games such as Brookhaven, Adopt Me, Airplane, and more! But why did Roblox remove the ""oof"" sound? Please bring ""oof"" back. I miss it! And one other question. Are some games only for computers or are all of them for any device? I'm asking because some games I play sometimes turn the screen black, but when I play on my computer the screen doesn't turn black. Anyway, it's a great game. Goodbye!"
1537,1538,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,_ItzRainbow_,"Lag / Quality- Roblox is a pretty fun game, its never boring for me in my opinion. There is a problem tho, it's the lag and the screen. Well everytime I am done updating roblox the quality was good but then it gets bad again. Screen that gets stuck sometimes- my screen gets stuck when I just stand and go afk bc I need to do something important, and gosh I am NOT happy-.. Please fix this so then it's not to frustrading.. ;-;"

1539,1540,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,chr1sychris,"It's an amazing game, yet there's some bugs with the camera. Like on mobile, the camera glitches and zooms in and out instead of just moving like wanted. And sometimes the camera moves crazy while walking. On PC, the camera sometimes doesn't move at all."

Out of no where! It really feaked me out. Plz fix these bugs! But minus that. Its a great game!Even tho i never got robux;( :)
1541,1542,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Eternal_ Choas,"If you could make it to where you had the option to turn on and off and set the time to whatever you wanted on the ""you've been inactive for 20 minutes"" that would be great because there are people such as me who have to go to extreme lengths to be afk for more than 20 minutes on mobile and also if you do make this update then could you please make it free and have no cooldown like when you want to change your display name. For the record I think changing your username should be free. Please."

Overall, it's a rlly fun game. But these problems are why I won't give more than 3 stars"

Another problem is whenever I'm playing a game it kicks me out for no reason making me restart the whole game. It also disconnects me from all of the games I was gonna play even tho my wifi is at full bars. If you guys could fix these bugs please do, it would be nice."
1544,1545,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Andrea Martinez,"Overall, its a great app. Nothing really wrong with it but It simply takes forever on the loading screen, which I thought it was my wi-fi, but it was all good. So not sure what happened. IF you could PLEASE fix this."

Other than that and jerks who play the game it's really fun. I leave only four stars because I can't create on mobile and that really sucks so if you get update the game or something so I can create on mobile I'll give five stars."

Other than that, and the fact that everytime I play a good game for 2 minutes instead of being able to move my camera I'm forced to zoom in, it's a good game!"
1547,1548,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,2,ameerah ღ,First of all I play roblox on my Samsung phone and I have a few issues with the app from time to time. 1. Whenever I play a game it will automatically switch to vertical mode. At first I thought this was cool but now this is getting annoying and it makes the controls very difficult to use. 2. Due to this I need to change the portrait of my phone from vertical to horizontal. When I come back into the game my zooming in and out is completely broken.
1548,1549,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Traci Friesen,While Roblox is popular. This has 100+ games and its just the robux that bugs me. You know you need a gift card or you buy it. But so many reasons it's nice to have this game. The most used problem or issue is that this game has disconnections and errors while playing a game. The phone version is slow and it's just not as nice as it appears. But trying it's better then leaving it.
1549,1550,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,City Girl,"I think this a great app but some things about it, I just don't get. So whenever I play any game, it might bring the settings thing down automatically and I make it go back up. After that, when I move, mi screen moves with me. So overall, this is a great game to play."
1550,1551,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Sophia Therese,"I like the game overall, the mobile menu kinda sucks, but its mostly utility>quality so its fine i guess. Only problem is that the camera gets stuck, recently experienced again while playing a first person game. A quick fix would be appreciated."
1551,1552,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Sophia Shaw,"The BEST game in the world my only problem is on mobile when you place 3 fingers on you're screen you can only move in and out, resetting your character doesn't work either so the only thing left as an option is leave. But other then that this is an awesome game and I love playing it!"
1552,1553,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Adeptus Xiao,"I have a lot to say. Unfortunately I only get so much space. If you see this review and play on a Chromebook, be warned. Right now it may seem like a fun ide; but trust me. It is NOT. You can't shiftlock, your cursor doesn't stay, and some games glitch and give you a mobile layout (which is VERY annoying). But this game is fun on tablets and such + it's not always bad on a chromebook so that's a pro as well. Enjoy Roblox!! :)"
1553,1554,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Z,"It's a very good game, the graphics are usually pretty good unless you have bad internet. There's a lot of free items so you can customize your avatar without spending money. It's a good game to meet friends in! I mostly prefer playing chill games but roblox has a big variety. Definitely recommend for people who want to socialize more easily and have fun too."

Other things are very good like graphics, controls. It's best game if it resolve these issues."

This game is hands down the most nostalgic when it comes to childhood games. Although... a few complaints... I really hate the new OOF sound.. its like.. augh!! And I hate it. Maybe tweak it just a little bit to sound more appealing. Also, I loved the concept of tix. Bring em back :((( Anyways, tysm for being a good game!"

The best part is it is a online game that doesn't contain ads every other online game probably contains ads when you play. I loved playing from litterally like every game in here. It may have a little bit of lag but different updates every few months, seasons and years. You can have online friends who can be kind and amazing people who might be your friends in real life."

I use roblox to chat and hang out, but as of the current moment, whenever I open it, it doesn't work. It won't send me to the login page, it won't send me to the home, it won't send me to nothing. All it does is show a black screen forever. Please fix this app."
1560,1561,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Brieana Cho,"I love this game! I really like how you can create new games to add to the Roblox game. There are so many types of games like obby's, tycoons, roleplay, and so much more. But sometimes it logs you out for no apparent reason. And when your wifi is completely okay, the experience says you have bad internet. I wish this was fixed."

1562,1563,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Ilana Ivy,"This app is good ! I think we should be able to speak more languages in some games but it's good and it's a good environment yes it can have some bad in it but that's what most apps have to deal with and also I think items should be free , more would probably play! Just a suggestion."
1563,1564,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Julie Vega,"I would rate it a five but there are some downsides so I would rather rate it a four cause of people hacking, dating, scamming, sending links, etc. But overall than that it's pretty good game there's tons of games to pick from! My personal favorite would have to be obbys. Roblox is really fun game to play! I would really recommend playing it!"
1564,1565,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Alora Cruwell,"Roblox is very fun, but there is a few flaws such as chat(chat will freeze time to time), security(hackers), lagging(dont even have to explain), and getting disconnected easily problems. Besides those,9/10 reccomend, especially if you have lots of free time cause it's a time killer."
1565,1566,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Kensley Kensley,"Firstly, This is great game, I love love playing it it's super fun🥰 second opinion, I have this problem actually TWO Problems. The first one is that when ever I play the game and I want to type something in as roleplay and etc It thinks I'm a computer and doesnt show me my keyboard⌨️. The second problem is that sometimes it kicks me out of the game when I'm playing🥊 and sends to the loading page. And it's not my phone cause I had this for years and same for Roblox so please fix this!!👨‍🔧😣"
1566,1567,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Takira Freeman,"I love this app, it may glitch sometimes and only let you zoom in and out and I think that bug needs to be fixed, Also there are so many different experiences to join all kinds of people you can meet and you can style in all different ways I love everything about this app and how it has so much good experience but the lag of some games I would love for that to be fixed also over all I give this app a 10/10 most definitely should download available on platforms such as android 5.0 n up thank you"
1567,1568,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,2,ashley,"The jump button is uncomfortable to use because it's too far on the right side. There are also glitches like I can't suddenly move my point of view, or when I play, the screen just turns to blue, or I'm just flying around endlessly"
1568,1569,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Macey Lou,"Roblox is great. One of the things I'm not really fond of, is that I find things very overpriced. Just for a face for your avatar, you have to pay up to 500 robux. The games are awesome. I recommend playing welcome to bloxburg. They have a good selection of things to do. Piggy is also a nice game. They have a good selection of games, including, Role playing games, collecting games, building games, mystery games, killer games, and so much more. They do have some glitches but other than that 👍"
1569,1570,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Brandon Weber,Often after playing for a while your ability to look around the screen fades and you can only zoom in and out I have to leave the whole app to fix it. But other than that it's an amazing game!
1570,1571,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,2,Darien Wendlandt,"it's a great game but occasionally the screen locks and I can't turn. I usually have to leave stuff that took me so long to do just for it to go away. other than that the game is great. Edit:FIX THE SCREEN LOCKING. I SWEAR TO GOD IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER. I just worked for HOURS on a build and then I have to leave because the screen locks. This is pissing me off to a different level. Fix it, everyone one is talking about it. There is no way you don't know about unless you are blind.Fix it.Please"
1571,1572,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Indie Lee Games,"This game has cured my boredness!! I love this game so much because I can play with my friends, make new friends and of course solve problems. Although there is one problem.. I have been seeing people online dating and people being rude to each other which I think is not ok because you don't know how much you can hurt someone. I would love this to be fixed but over all 4/5!"
1572,1573,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Sword YT,"Yeah... about that. So basically when we update, the game always never lets me pass the 2Step Verification. So overall, it's not that bad. Also fix the filter issue, I say ""Give"" but it just does ""####"", or by typing numbers like 287282, it'll be ended up as ""######""."
1573,1574,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Imogen Last,"Its really good and fun wouldn't recommend it to young people after some people can be rude and inappropriate but it is fun and you can play with your friends and make new friends you can build houses, role-play or find secrets in games one of my favourite games to play is brookhaven it is free to play and enjoy making new friends."
1574,1575,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Valeria Hernandez,"It's a great game, and also really fun, but I have a big- ish phone and the jump button seems very small. I was hoping their could be an update, that can let us ( the player) pick the size of the jump button ( bigger and smaller)"
1575,1576,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,Isabella Nixon,"why you should download roblox!!! First, it has lots of different fun games insideof one!! they are all really fun, you can dress up your avatar, find new friends, and have enjoyable moments!! There are different gammes for different age groups! I started playing when I was 6!! I enjoyed it then and I still do!!"
1576,1577,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Madison,"I like this game a lot! It has optional games you can play. If I'm honest, I play it most of the time. The only thing thats keeping me away from pressing the 5th star are the glitches,errors, and bugs. Over all , amazing game!"
1577,1578,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Aquatic King,"Roblox is a really good game! But in some games i do lag and in the catalog it says ""the sever is busy please try again later"" or i dont have internet connection but i do this feature really bugs me and when im in the middle of a game my camra gets stuck and when i try zooming in or out it doesent work and when im walking it just stops me dead in my track i have to wait a while till i can walk again but other than that it is a really good game I also get stuck in shiftlock."
1578,1579,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Cincere Pryor,Good I mean the game is so good but it's just a few problems when the Wi-Fi doesn't work it'll kick you off to where you have to keep resigning and resigning off and then you got to keep updating it oven every time you reupdate it it deletes everything to where you got to start all the way over it's just annoying but I really like the game and it's really fun so I'll rate it up a thousand out of 1000 the game is so Good 😊
1579,1580,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,Cadence Sipe,"Soooo this app is really fun! There are lots of games inside and you can even make your own! Some apps I play are: royal high, meepcity, any survival games, tower of hell, etc. My only problem is I get kicked out of royal high alot of the time and I play on mobile but it doesn't seem to do that on my brothers Xbox or the computer 💻. Please fix this! Besides that the games really fun! 😊"
1580,1581,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Mezuyakii,"Roblox is quite a well-made game, but I honestly don't prefer it over Minecraft or games similar to it. I do like it because theres a wide selection of items to choose from the avatar shop or the catalog. Theres also a wide variety of games on the app which is nice. I hate that they haven't fixed the reporting problem, scammers, online daters or the bypassers. I suggest if you'd like to keep the game going, you should fix the minor problems and make the game even better by reading feedback. 4/5"
1581,1582,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,2,Felix M,"pretty nice app, cool games and easy to use. the only thing i have a problem with is robux, its so hard to get it for some people, and some people just don't wanna spend the money. there should be like a daily check in or missions to complete for robux. - edit: my game now freezes randomly, randomly pauses my music for no reason, and my camera thingy sometimes starts working weird? i can't describe it though"
1582,1583,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Kinsleigh Fink,Roblox is a good app But I do have some problems with it sometimes when I'm in the middle of a game my screen will automatically freeze and it takes it 15-20 minutes to stop freezing and that's really annoying when you're in the middle of a game when you're in a game with your friends because and I also think there should be more stuff in the Avatar shop for people without robux because when I didn't have robux I barely had any options
1583,1584,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Vivian Anaya,I like this game very much because there are so many games you can do different things in and now different games have different graphics like arsenal is more realistic than non-realistic i recommend this game to any age group for a fun time and my favorite part is the multiplayer!
1584,1585,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Katerina Sayer,"This game has been amazing in lockdown and otherwise. Although I think there can be a few changes added to the game,firstly there are rude things said in chat and I think that something needs to be done(yes I know there is report). Secondly I don't know if its just my electronic but when you press chat it flickers black and white.But other than those two I love the game and think other people will like it,the features and graphics are absolutely amazing! I hope more people download roblox!"
1585,1586,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Kierstyn,"Roblox allows people to express themselves, and let them have fun. I have been playing this game for 4 years, and I really do enjoy it. However, I play on a chromebook, and you have to download the app inorder to play. I find that it makes it extremely hard to play roblox, because the app is designed for mobile devices. One of the biggest issues I have is that Roblox always disconnects me within five minutes of playing the game. I know this is not my internet, as I can play other video games."
1586,1587,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Toto Sanchez,"Roblox is great it has multiple choices to choose from,but There's one bug that I've accurd of sometes when im messing around woth the screen is just turns all weird like you can move the screen but ot keeps getting close or darther and ot moves all over the place when o try to move, That's my only bug,but other than that roblox is a really good game :)"
1587,1588,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Jose Antonio Escalante,"i like the game but I hate the new oof sound,bring back the old one, it was good! >:( when I try to rotate the camera, it zooms! I disconnect for no reason the internet connects and disconnects and the connection error stuff which I'm very frustrated at. ALSO CAN YOU STOP WITH THE TAGS ALREADY, ITS VERY ANNOYING YOU KN9OW, DAVID BAZUCKI Alot of people are not pleasant about the new oof sound. Bring all the good features back"
1588,1589,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Heather Tyler,"The reason I gave this four stars is because of the disconnections even though I KNOW my internet is completely fine. I get cut out after every 5 minutes when I try to play the game. Please fix this bug, I'd really appericiate it. Although, I really love this game, it's the best and I definitely recommend it."
1589,1590,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,3,Shamyreia,"Roblox is a great game platform. It has a multitude of game to play that are fun for all age groups. The only problems I have with it is: I've been getting kicked out of games for the last 2 weeks. My phone would freeze and it take for ever to load most games. I did everything but the Roblox app still continue freezing when I'm in the middle of a game. My wifi and phone is fine its the app. So please fix it, most people are having the same problem too."
1590,1591,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,El Frizelle,"I like it, but some games on mobile are in a way that you can't play them. And sometimes in the parkour obbies, the glitch is impossible to get out of. I literally had to turn off my phone because the game was frozen. But overall, it's alr"
1591,1592,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Nataly Llamas,"There's a lot of hackers in games and it's getting annoying. It's mostly in a game called da hood. They fly around and they can punch while moving, it doesn't let us move and super punch. This is getting horrible. Please fix this problem, Thank you."
1592,1593,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,3,Shyamali Guerrero,"So many options, but it glitches a lot on mobile and you'll have to rejoin the game to fix it, sometimes making u lose progress. It also sometimes lag a lot making the game almost impossible to play. But besides all of that it's pretty fun"
1593,1594,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Jc Burchfield,I love the game super fun but there is this glitch were like I'll be playing a game or something and I'll press the screen to turn my view and it'll just freeze and only zoom in and out and when I reset my character it doesn't do anything and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person having this problem but overall it's a fun game just that one glitch
1594,1595,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Jake Muhle,"i think this game is a great thing overal. I have been playing this game for about 4 years now, and i only have two issues. 1; almost all the games are lagging now for me. so in like a shooter game, i'm in the middle of a battle, and the game is lagging so much that when i have shot this dude like 10 times, it says that i miss him but he hits me first try. 2; while I'm in the middle of playing the game, the game will log me out. i have had this happen to me on more than one accation. it is fun!!"
1595,1596,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Arianna Morado,"Great app and easy to use but i had a problem, i updated it and tried playing and it hasn't loaded the game yet, i don't know if this is a problem or not but i need this fixed and if it could be possible u could maybe add a non-binary option for when u make a new account or barely start to play because it is a problem."
1596,1597,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Vanora Lytle,"I recommend this game, it is a fun multi game platform where you can do almost anything your heart desires. For example: you can roleplay, fight, play shooting games, competive multiplayer, and experience the latest trends. If this sounds fun download it."
1597,1598,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Trexiegacha Skater,"This game is super buper amazing and I would really rate this a five star. But I do have some issues. There are games that are scamming, and also Oder's. And when I play on mobile phone it is so laggy and glitchy. And some of the games are getting ruined. So pls fix this."
1598,1599,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,Jennifer Demo,"I have loved and played roblox since i was 7 and its gotten better through the years im 12 now and still love it even though everyone thinks its ""dead"" i still love the game and the content on it my only 2 things that i think should be removed and fixed are 1: the chat filter, its just too annoying like how words that arent even swears are filtered and would love that to be fixed 2: glitches and lag, i hope this can be fixed i play and get laggy or glitch out of the game losing my progress."
1599,1600,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Khloe Anderson,"It's a good game. I would 100% recommend it, it's basically like a game inside of a game. You get to create your avatar and explore worlds, but the only reason I gave it a 4-star is because their is no ability to layer hair, or face accessories. I honestly think this would be a good improvement. Either way a very good game."
1600,1601,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Warren Tainter,This is a great app and I love it there's just a bug I have it's when I get in the app it will take like forever then after I wait it will say connection error and I have to reset it and it does the same thing over again if this could be fixed then I'd rate it 5 stars and another bug is when I'm playing a game on this app after awhile I can't move my screen it happens often and idk why but again nice app! 👌
1601,1602,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,2,drew medeiros,"It was great but it some times doesn't load but I have full bars of wifi and it will tell me that I'm disconnected from the internet. Sometimes it kinds sucks. If roblox cooperation sees this I would like to tell them that they might need to tweak eoblox up a bit cause it's kind of glitchy, not only that, I'm sure other people have the same exact problem. You haven't fixed the problem and you guys said you did. I really hope in the next update you fix this. You are making me upset. Please fix."
1602,1603,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,3,mlg auto,"Roblox is an enjoyable game to play every thing is fine when I play on it but for some reason when I'm playing (using dynamic joystick) it decides to just zoom in and out while I'm moving the joystick. The normal joystick works too but later on it does the same thing but it gets stuck, fix the game Roblox support your community."
1603,1604,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Ron Gamer,"It a very fun game with no ads. Tho I am here to complain that when you turn off and on in 2-3 secs the camera doesn't work at all at any game. Even if you reset it doesn't work. Then when you find a friend, you can't play. So, I say it very problematic, please do a update. So it works..."
1604,1605,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Dakk Zonda,"Very nice game overall, but there are still bugs, and glitches. Still it is a fun, mostly family friendly game. Only thing i would change are some games that are pay to win basically but other than that the game is perfect for most ages."
1605,1606,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Damara Mowad-Stevens,Love the game but I'm upset about two things. The first being all the glitches and bugs especially the screen glitch where you can only zoom in and out and the other glitch where the jump button gets stuck. Second being the new death sound!!! It's really weird!?!?
1606,1607,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,2,Andrew Birtz,"This is a good game. Or, that's what I would say if there wasn't so much lag, crashing, and freezing. I can play every other game normally and watch anything normally, but this game gives me the HARDEST time out of everything. I have never seen any game this slow in my life. The games are good, but the system is terrible."
1607,1608,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Roz Khdir,"I would rate this game a total 5 stars! And there's reason's why. First reason is that you can make new friends and play all type of cool, adventurous and rolepay games . Second reason is that you can chat and tell your own opinions on stuff that other people say. Final reason is that you can play the game in any of your free time. Although, there can be lockdowns in roblox, bugs, hackers and scammers. You can always report or block things you disagree with. Other than that, this is amazing!"
1608,1609,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,3,Jaxon Bennett,I like it. But when I play big games my game crashes. I tried everything and don't use Lack of memory as a excuse. I have a lot of gigabytes so just listen. It's always happening. It is frustrating. So get it done!
1609,1610,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Andrei Ello,"4 stars because the jump button is a bit low and placed at the corner, maybe adjusting the jump button will be better. It is hard to touch. But the game itself is good and you can play lots of games."
1610,1611,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,3,Lonley Papi,I've been playing roblox for 4 years and it's a really fun game. BUT there have been things in my closet that disappear over time. What I mean by that is when I go into my shirts for example (this goes for all items that can be purchased) I don't see what I purchased anymore. The item just appears as loading. I can't wear it either. It's really annoying how this happens because I don't even get my robux back. Please fix this roblox.
1611,1612,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Jill Beany,"Roblox is a great game to play with friends. You can be creative with your avatar and your own games. The only problem though is some creations aren't appropriate and need to be banned, such as hateful games. Also, my friend had someone sign in to her phone, and after that she hasn't been able to sign in to her account. She thinks someone hacked in and changed the password. Over all, roblox is a great game."
1612,1613,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,Francine nanquil,"Oml- it's litterly the best game I have ever downloaded, but there's some things I dislike, such as: getting hacked and getting banned for no reason, that has happened to me twice but luckily I was allowed to make another account. Not to mention roblox removing the 'oof' sound, for the matter of fact I just miss it so much. Overall it's a great game since it has many category of games to pick, all of the games are fantastic but some of the unusual games are a bit of a risk.."
1613,1614,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Ur MOTHER,"I love this game, been playing it since 2018. The experiences and events are nice. There are some issues and bug where you can not move or you can only move your screen for mobile. Other than that, more people should play this game!"
1614,1615,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Crafty Fox _24,I can be able to watch videos and play games at the same time. (I have a old phone so it might be different for tablets or newer versions. ) The only problem I have is when I open another app it exes me out of the game . Then it goes back to the home page which is really annoying.

My problem is that ever since the new updates it's been harder and harder for me to even play Roblox without me lagging so bad that I can't even load anything in a game, heck I'm lucky if I even get to play a game. For months I've been having problems, please fix it...."
1616,1617,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,yan _,"I really like this game but i hope you could fix some of the bugs like, 1.when i search something in the shop,unrelevant item pop out but not the item that ive been searching for. 2.the screen bug😩 its so annoying when i play some game in roblox the screen gonna zoom in and I can't turn around i can only zoom in and out the screen,even when i reseting my character the screen bug is still there😞 well im still gonna give it 5 star tho bcs its my fav game<3"

1618,1619,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,3,alcair Amerol,"This game is a 3 star, bare with me for a second, so the game is kinda fun but the control glitches and it moves the screen when i swipe the move button, and the screen glitches when i swipe the screen and press the menu it'll freeze my screen so can you fix this because it gets in the way for the experience to be more enjoyable"
1619,1620,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Crystal Goetz,You're right I hate when that happens we're only able to zoom in and zoom out cuz your screen just gets frozen everything's frozen you just try to resume or reset your character and then all it does is that that's the only bad thing about it though sometimes it's laggy but still real fun .
1620,1621,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,goodgirl_gacha 1,"It is a nice fun game but they should fix some of the games, some of the old games are super laggy and some of them kick you out for no reason, I prefer the 2017 roblox and it brings back many memories and less laggy stuff, I would also like to say that they should make adopt me potions a bit cheaper so I think there should me a limit amount of robux that you need to use for games"
1621,1622,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,5,Jared Eason,I absolutely love this game if you don't have this get it! It's the best. Edit: fix the bug where your screen gos in and out if you try and turn and it won't turn also fix where it says same user launched in different experience or something but other then that BEST GAME EVER GET IT!!
1622,1623,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,JEFF Streetband,I usually play some games like adopt me but when there's a lot of players it basically lags because of so many players and sometimes it crash the game and then make me leave the experience and the screen sometimes the screen frozed and it will make me in and out only. So I will say 4 stars but I still love this game❤.
1623,1624,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Aria Moran,Its an amazing game except it randomly kicks me out of the game I'm playing saying there is a connection problem when my wifi is full bars! I have been trying to play roblox for the past 3 days and this problem still goes on and I have many other online things I do and they aren't giving me this problem that's how I know it's not my internet it's the game! I really enjoy playing this game but I can't play it if it won't let me...maybe there is a bug in the game
1624,1625,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Danielle Williams,it has amazing clothing and hairs. i also love the accessories for my avatar! me and my friends play it all the time. we also do reccomend that when you remove an item or a game to give all the robux we spent on it back to us because it really isnt fair. so -1 star. anyways thats it. its an amazing game!
1625,1626,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Desilu Ulised,"I love this game, but a few issues i have with it, are it gets very laggy At times, and the items are a little pricey, also the rejoin button never works, and somtimes when i open the app, it logs me out! The game over all is great, but please fox these few problems."
1626,1627,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,3,Lance Obar,"The game was good but i rated it 3 stars because there was so many bugs in this game. First, i was moving the Joystick (because i was on mobile) and the Joystick can move the screen too. And other bugs about the screen. I hope your reading this Developers."

But there is a tiny problem,for example..in bloxburg when I'm at the settings and then I'm in first person, it doesn't let me zoom in or out it only let's me scroll up and down. But again this is a really great game :)"
1628,1629,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Elasia Jones,This game is amazing! But It has a delay and a bit of lag I think it needs a bit adjustments to the mobile players but everything else is fine I really like this game. If you like building and stuff and like adventure and battling and ext. I recommend this game!
1629,1630,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Rilea Root,"It's a really good app bit there is 3 problems the first one is that you have to update is to much almost every week and I think thats not necessary the second problem is that u have to buy robux and I think there should be able to earn it and the third problem is that the connection like for example I was playing bloxburg and I kept on getting kicked out because of my ""internet connection "" but even tho my internet is perfectly fine but yea please fix those things thank you!❤"
1630,1631,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Alpha Wolf,It is fine but when I put my password it keeps saying its wrong so I went to forgot password/username and it says to put the 6 digit code that has been sent to me and i put it in but nothing happens and it takes me back to the same screen.I am very angry and I can't log in. I have been on YouTube searching for vids on how to log in and it won't work But other than all that it is an amazing game many things to do and overall very good.
1631,1632,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Camdyn Ob,this game is amazing.. i love roblox but there are a few problems number 1 is that sometimes on laptop or computer it randomly starts spinning uncontrollably and I can't stop but I never had issues like that on mobile number 2 is that the screen locks in place and I can't do anything but look in and out but if those things were fixed Roblox will be way better
1632,1633,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Francesca Law,"Great game! You can play with friends there are like millions of games to play. But.. its annoying when simple words that are not inappropriate are tagged out. Sometimes I just want a conversation with someone but I can't wrote a single sentence without hashtqgs over the words I want to write. I totally understand this for bad languages, addresses etc but not for everyday words. Also it's pretty easy to get hacked and most robloxians buy atleast $5/£5/€5 so it's a waste of money. Still great!!!!"
1633,1634,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Kerapetse Thabeng,"This game is very amazing especially the obies games but there is only one problem,there needs to be more check marks because imagine when there is 2 steps before you win Nad you miss a step and you fall down to the beginning and really makes fiercely what to throw out ipad,PC,in the water"
1634,1635,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Bryant Bornor,"This is a great game! But there are some things you need to fix... there are online daters in almost every game, it's annoying, but overall its a fun game! But I Love How It's like our own app store but you don't have to download it. im trying to get into the star program right now and im working on it! Plus i've Been Playing This Game Since 2018 or 2016 And I still Enjoy it!"
1635,1636,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Beth Harris,"I really enjoy this game it is free for every device and is very enjoyable. From games to making new friends, and having more experiences. I really recommend this game although it can be a bit glitchtcy on some devices but all in all this is a great platformed game and I do really recommend it!"
1636,1637,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Blackout _Out,"This app is great, but when you do some games like the mimic on chromebook, you cant use ur keys to look around and its annoying. I wish the robux was less pricey and more good looking items for free so that people without robux can have some cool acesories. Otherwise, the game is great! I love to make new friends on this game"
1637,1638,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Hi Hi,"When there is a new update I have to get it before I can play which is annoying. I also free up space to do this then it says there is an error so I do everything the app store tells me to do to fix this but, it doesn't work so I give the app three stars except for this it's great."
1638,1639,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Gracie Healy,Roblox is a very fun game that I could play for hours. It has a variety of games so it can pretty much entertain everyone. But it can also lag a bit and take a very very long time to load. If these bugs were fixed that would make it even better. Overall it's a pretty good game.
1639,1640,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Peyton Hope,The only problem is it's buggy but also like everyone says when you try to change the angle it zooms in and you would have to leave the game your playing it sucks for tycoon people when it does that you gotta lose all your progress but out of all that nothing else bothers me so it's good besides does things
1640,1641,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,AspiringNataliepop,Played since 2016 and loved it. Still do. But on mobile there is a glitch that has been around for so long where your screen can only zoom in and out or your screen doesn't move at all when you try to move it
1641,1642,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,5,Dan Loomis,"This is a amazing game that you can chose a variety of amazing games from shooting zombies to customizing houses. This is by far my favorite game I am absolutely obsessed with the game, my favorite game is Brookhaven, you can ro play with friends, ride vehicles, and get an amazing job. You can get amazing game passes at amazing prices,but by far my favorite thing in the game is the houses, they are all unique in their own way and have really cool secrets inside. I love roblox 5 stars 🌟 🤩."
1642,1643,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,5,Rowen Rose Southgate,"It's amazing, passes time, you can play with your friends, make your own game, edit your avatar and so much more! I have experienced just a few bugs but overall definitely recommend!"
1643,1644,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Noor awara,Its a really cool game we can plus with friends and roleplay. But there are some bugs sometimes you can't move the rotation and the screen freezes. But its fine and I want the games to load a bit faster. Glad this game was made but can you add more free stuff to?
1644,1645,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,elijah hayes,I find the game fun but there are a few issues every time I log into a game it just starts out white but it just goes back to whatever color it was and then starts out white and just keeps doing that I keep turning off my phone powering it off and that doesn't even work so it is a pretty good way I would like amend this but just watch out for that problem
1645,1646,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Alexis Webb,"Overall, roblox is an amazing app. You can play multiple games, hangout with friends, and socialize with like-minded people. Robux is reasonably priced and you can customize your character to your liking which I find to be a big bonus. The only thing I don't like about the app is the amount of scams that go on in certain games, as well as online daters. Roblox has definitely gotten better over the years but it could still use some work. Other than that, it's an amazing app!"
1646,1647,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,falynn whitlock,"A great game for kids, as it offers so many opportunities and places to explore. It can entertain me for hours because there are so many different genres of games that it's impossible to get bored. There are tycoons, simulators, scary games, story games, roleplaying games, logic games, and so many other things. And if you don't find something you like, then you can try your hand at making it on your own for other people to play as well."
1647,1648,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,XXX-Killer Sans-XXX,"Its amazing there so many games to play and so many friends a s since covid is happening I think it's a good way to have fun, there is sm I hate about it, is that it costs 1,000 robux just to reset your password,like, why not put a timer until you can change it again for like, a week or 2, like that's stupid, everything else is great though-"
1648,1649,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Annie Franks,"This is a good game, but whenever I want to upgrade, it doesn't work a lot, so maybe can u sort that out? Also, in Adopt me, there is many scammers in the game. Although of all the bugs in the game, overall it's a great game. Keep it up Roblox!"
1649,1650,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Jaiden Josue Cadorette,"Roblox is an excellent game that I have been playing for years, but especially now there are more hackers, games that can ban your account, and glitches that get very annoying and repetitive. However, on the good side, there is free UGC items that I completely love the look of, people who are amazing friends, and plenty of games to keep you from being bored. Thank You Roblox, for trying your best to keep a safe environment. ❤"
1650,1651,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Susie Clen,"Roblox is a great game! There are so many things to do and you can play with your friends. You have to play with internet though. Also you can't type numbers, you do need to update the app quite a lot, there are quite a lot of bugs, people can scam you and it can be kind of glichy, but there are so many games to play (like obbies, roleplay games, fighting games...) and all ages can find something appropriate for their age to play. Overall I give the game a 4 stars. Have a great day! :)"
1651,1652,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Rosangeli Soto,Roblox is the best app sometimes it's glitchy sometimes I can't look where I want to look can you please fix that other than that it's great I just want you to fix the glitching and make sure people can move where they want to see because whenever I touch the screen try to look in a different place it will not do that that only happens sometimes just please fix that and fix some glitches I actually found one game that had a bug it was bloxburg I saw a bug so please can you fix that thank you
1652,1653,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Hayejin Kwon,"It keeps on saying ""update"" when i update it it needs to delete apps. Now heres the problem. I keeps deleting apps until my apps were FREAKING 7! and when i update it nothing happens. No update no nothing changed. Now i have too play it on another device because it keeps on saying ""uPdAtE"" sooo yeah."
1653,1654,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,wan qaiśara,"Hello! This game is really good! I have play it for years and i love it here! The multiple choice games here make me want to continue being here. However, i need to complain or maybe ask about purchasing. I couldn't purchase any robux. I don't know abt the other player but maybe could you tell me what to do? I have already verified my account and payment method but still can't purchase any robux. I hope you can answer this. Thank you for the game ):)"
1654,1655,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,4Yuki Chan4,"It's a very unique game and is really fun and good to use when you have to pass time but it isn't good on mobile. Constantly it glitches on mobile and I wasn't able to even play some of my favorite games. So if anyone plays this, you should know to get it on computer."
1655,1656,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,Autumn Malanca,"Its an awsome app, 100% recommend, but, i try to update it, and it just keeps saying i cant. i have a lot of space left, and i mean a lot, and i have tried restarting the phone. It just wont work. It never did this before on any other update."
1656,1657,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Coco !!,"I love this game, because there’s sooo many game in this one apps. The reason I give it 3 stars is, the camera bug. When I try to swipe the camera to left, the camera doesn’t even move . it just zoom in and zoom out ... and you need to rejoin the game so that the camera will work perfectly. this bug is really bad especially for an obby and an adventure stories player.. please fix this asap in the next update, it's hard to enjoy this game because of the bug. :("
1657,1658,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,GAMER GIRL,Such a great game! It really makes me feel great! And the amount of experiences are amazing! But theres this problem that sometimes your screen gets stuck and the items are a bit to expensive. Great game tho!
1658,1659,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,Alex Silva,"So, when i tried to purchase Robux the screen that would normally appear didn't. This isn't a very major thing but i would appreciate if you kind folks fix it. Other than that. I've had extremely fun and amazing experiences with this game!"
1659,1660,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Zhianne Yodico,i would rate his 4 - 5 but when i look around the screen zoom out and i cant zoom in 2. and when i play some games i would get kicked out forsome reasons i don't really know and when i go to setting and resume the camera will just move randomly and when i try jumping it auto jumps and walk and when i try to walk it zooms out and in. please fix it!
1660,1661,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,mazin alwheeb,Hey! I have had some trouble with playing games! They kick me out for absolutely no reason at all! It's just saying that I'm kicked out when I haven't joined the game before! and Also Can you Update the thing with setting system because it was easier for Me before but the rest is OK! (+Leaving the game features)Overall I Recommend this app a lot!!!
1661,1662,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,3,Atlas,"This game is so fun! my only complaints are how strict the censorship is, how on mobile the camera gets weird at times (not letting you look around, just zoom in and out) as well as the search in the catalog being really vague on mobile (you want classic shirts? Have fun scrolling through 400+ 3d clothing options before you even get there.)"
1662,1663,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Isla A,"Ive been playing this game for years and it's a good game. When I was !ittle my mom use to put restrictions so I didn't befriend random people. I love how you can customise your character. 2 problems tho, 1 old men try to online date you and do inappropriate things, 2 you can't go on some games because it just kicks you off and you have to login into your account witch has lost me multiple accounts with robux on. Overall it's a cool game to play with your friends and have a laugh."
1663,1664,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Connor Payne,First of all I love this game. I really enjoy that you can play any games and make friends . Second of all... I like how the characters move and the animations. And I kind of like how you can change for r6 and r15. I don't really like how in some games you only have r15 not your normal animations. Sometimes if you have the normal animation in some games it changes it to r15 Roblox change plz it's really anxious. Fird of all it's really good don't have anything else to say lol! GET RID OF HAKERS!
1664,1665,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,3,Marla Malicat,"It's very nice. The game itself is nice but, the reason why i gave it a 3 cause i wasted all my money just for robux and, WHY ARE YOU SPENDING REAL MOMEY JUST FOR IN-GAME MONEY!? The other reason why I rated it a 3 it's cause when I am in the middle of playing a game, my screen freezes and I have to restart all my progress. Please fix it but keep up the good work."
1665,1666,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,2,UrA1DollaWh0re,"It's a good game...but it WON'T LET ME PLAY! I just redownloaded it and when I opened it, hoping to play some good mf game, but I GOT STUCK ON A LOADING SCREEN! I uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted my phone, and even checked for updates. But it still won't get off the initial loading screen no matter how long I wait!!! Please for the love of god someone HELP!!"

Basically,u tap on the surcle on the bottom of Ur device and the tap the square and get back in and Ur done!😉😉"
1667,1668,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Trey Nash,"This is a really fun online multiplayer game that I really enjoy playing. There are tons of games you can play but it's annoying that you can't play certain games on a phone. The games also randomly disconnect, which is annoying. Sometimes they delete the clothes you bought because people haven't bought them in a while which is upseting because you payed money for them. You can also get hacked on this game so be careful. You should also watch out for cyber bullies. But other than that it's good."
1668,1669,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,Ginger Casper,"(This is my grandma's phone) Roblox is a good game and all, But when your playing a game holding a phone if thas what your using, sometimes it'll glitch and while your walking in game it'll automatically show the icon that says ""reset leave or resume"" and then when you get out of it you can't even turn your screen, it only let's you zoom in and out and if it happens again it won't let you do anything with your screen but walk in a game. This needs to be fixed.."
1669,1670,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,A Google user,"Thanks for fixing the glitches, the game is stabilized, and better, I appreciate the game, thank you. For those who are just downloading this game, I would really suggest it, there is is something out there for everyone! Drawing games, to fighting, and role playing, and you can even make your own! Really think everyone should give it a try, really nice and though out app. Highly recommend."
1670,1671,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Sam,"This is a very fun, entertaining game to play when you are bored. There are many ways to dress up your avatar and so many games to play. It is a very social game, you can make lots of friends on here too, that way games dont get too boring. There are many badges you can win and a bunch of passes to get. You can even win some items from the games themselves. I definently recommend this game to others, it is time well spent and very fun! <3"
1671,1672,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Scarlett Finch,"Roblox is a fun and interesting game to play I've been playing for years now and it's still really fun! I gave it 5 starts because it's well deserved. The only complain is that roblox brakes a lot more than it should. Also the ""oof"" sound is gone I know it isn't Robloxs fault but it's kinda bad now. Overall it's a good game and I completely recommend it."
1672,1673,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,3,welcome to valerieland,"Roblox is an amazing game and all, but there are many issues. For example, whenever I join a game it kicks me out of the whole app and if I do end up getting in the game its just extremly laggy and glitchy. When im playing something it just says i disconnected when my internet is 100% full. Also, the game requires so much space. I play mobile and sometimes it gets so bad i cant even update my avatar. Lastly, there should be more cloth options for new people that cant afford robux. good game tho!"
1673,1674,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Jannat Rahman,"This game is totally amazing- i literally cant live without it. i seriously recommend this game, i have never seen a game with over 1 million games inside it. roblox is a GREAT game, and also has fantastic games on it. However, high graphic games cause me to crash and then i cant go back to roblox. but this is not a problem as i can just download it again :/. there are also great remixes of other games and realistic stuff and yh- i love this game to bits, keep it up roblox!:D we all love it! :)"
1674,1675,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Ł ß,I like how it has many games for when your bored but I don't like how sometimes my character will jump when I'm not pressing the jump button and how it kicks me out of games. It does have glitches. And I don't like how when I try to move my screen zoomed itself in and out. Its annoying. But other than that I like to play it when I'm bored.
1675,1676,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,2,lazy_shinkuu,"Why is my Roblox suddenly not working for me while all my other friends have their application working for them? It's frustrating. I'm connected to the internet and it's pretty strong when I use to her apps. I keep on logging out, deleting and installing the game so it would work for me but it just doesn't seem to work today anymore. Why is this happening? Edit: filters in your chat is pissing me off. I can't even write my own name!"
1676,1677,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,2,Alessia,"Roblox is the best! In the past it was. In the past I could play those fun games, but now it's no use to play Roblox. I can't even play a single game, I can play less than 1 game. I gave it 2 stars because in the past I was having lots of fun, but now? Like I said, ITS NO USE TO PLAY ROBLOX. now bye, I will come back to Roblox if you fix this issue. And dennis? I read his review, that same only zoom in and out glitch happens to me in most games."
1677,1678,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Nour Mandour,"I LOVE THIS GAME ITS THE BEST GAME EVER ,but there's a glitch it's like a camera glitch I don't have a problem with it you can just leave and rejoin but you can be doing something important, for example:if your playing scp 3008 and you have alot of food if you leave and rejoin you will lose all the food and your way point too but its a great game I recommend never getting rid of it"
1678,1679,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,3,Lee Rez,"I do like this game and it's really amazing! But there are a few problems. I disconnect a lot for no reason and when I'm playing with others I also get disconnected and I cant get in again. Also everytime I make an account it deletes it and I lose my progress. So, if you can, could you please fix these problems?"
1679,1680,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Mario Sharra,"Amazing game. But to much bugs have been found by so many people. Some games can be randomly laggy on some phones. Like: Samsung, Huawei, Dodgee etc. And the games that can be found laggy is: murder mystery 2, tower of h@ll, tower of misery etc. Thats the reason why im giving it 4 stars. Just the bugs are so annyoing. Pls fix it. I have been playing this game since 2021/hated the bugs etc. So pls fix it. Thats the most annyoing thing in some games."

Its amazing!"
1681,1682,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Pashmina Balquedra,"I give 4/5 because it have so many bugs and when I try to sign up it said (please retry) ,when I get avatar it is always laggy, when I play it is always zoom in and zoom out and it is jumping.

1683,1684,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,MyNameIsNotDavid Ok?,Its a great game but the screen glitches and the dynamic joystick is wacky and it kicks me out of the game but it will fix if you uninstall and reinstall but it can still happen again but the main focus is the games they are excellent (except for the games that are not) but the games page has good games nonetheless
1684,1685,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Madimak Morgan,"I give this game 5 stars since I grew up on Roblox and have been playing for a long time. Whenever I'm bored it's my go to game. Even though sometimes Roblox is down due to a few technical difficulties, it always works out in the end and we get to have fun playing it. Though there are different styles around such as preppy, cnp, slenders etc , everyone has fun."
1685,1686,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,2,Gabriel M Montalvo,"Roblox has very questionable decisions in terms of looking into NFTs, Pushing the idea of a metaverse in the worst ways possible, and Voice chat being limited to only some. Also the experience on Android and such is extremely laggy. Also at this point you'd think they would add more computer power to their darn systems"
1686,1687,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Peyton Geller,"Great game, Although that sometimes the screen glitches and when i reset, I can't move the camera and i can't move my character. I would like if this bug will be fixed, but overall, Its an awesome experience"
1687,1688,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,4,Charlotte Drew,there are some things wrong with it like the lag and the slow chat. but it has crashed twice and it needs some new games plus it does not show my avatar so it is okay but the good thing about it is that it is fun and has tags to stop something mean or rude from happining so overall i give it a 4.5 xx also i wish like most of the clothing and hair was free
1688,1689,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Adione Van der Merwe,A love this game it has a lot of fun games to play.🌼 There is just 2 problems when a play a game it kicks me out and the second one my WiFi is there on my screen and a can't get in it happens sense last night and I'm trying to get in. ☹️
1689,1690,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Jovita Abucay,"This game is pretty fun and decent, The only things that are a bit off for me are that, you have to pay to change your group name-? Honestly i think thats kinda crazy because, you already purchased the game, so what if you want to change the name??? And my second one, is that some of the games are really laggy, and like theres this game that doesnt let me join, so basically i click join, then when it goes into the game it just exits me out of roblox, and into my ipad homescreen."
1690,1691,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Barirah Muzamil,"It's an amazing app and entertainment for me, I play it almost every now and then, whenever I have time. I mostly play with my best friend from school, it's so fun. I will give it 5 stars, but the thing is, you have to pay actual money to get robux, which is kinda unfair. The rule Roblox made is pretty unfair, 'cause you can atleat give like 2 or 3 robux FOR AT LEAST A MONTH! No offense, though! Really amazing development, thanks to this game, it makes me feel calm, somehow."
1691,1692,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Kayla Maldonado,"This is an amazing game overall.Its one of those games with many games inside.Its very fun 👍.You can make games but only on pc, play with your friends,play by yourself,and play games.Not much more to say about it.But on mobile sometimes the screen won't move, I don't know if that problem happens on any other devices."
1692,1693,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Shinko Jokyo,I honestly think it's a great game but there's something that's happened to me way to many times and that's getting logged out of my account. I've been locked out of a total of 4 of my accounts and I kept having to make new ones and start all over from my game progress. I don't know if this is just me but I'd really love to get back into those accounts
1693,1694,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Julia Loehn,I love roblox. when will you guys make more games like that? It is the best game ever!! There are so many different games for different people! It is fun and teaches you things!! Like: Tower of Hell - Never give up even when you fall! Welcome to Bloxburg - Money doesn't just grow on trees you have to work hard for it!! #robloxislife
1694,1695,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,JJ NN,I like the game....but in many of the games you have to pay robux to get things. I do like that you get to play with multiple people/make friends. I think that you should get more free things.... no ads which is good...... overall this is a good game.
1695,1696,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Kingston Cash,"I really like this game it's fun and it's nice to explore and experience different games,there's some glitch that happens we're the screen only zooms in and out it's very anyoing whenever your playing with your friends or role playing some times I think it would lose downloads because of that please fix it I really like this game please update it more it's really fun and you can make your avatar look like your self haha it's kinda funny we're you can make funny avatars please make more updates"
1696,1697,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,noah468 Corp.,Played the game for ages but I have to help my younger brother with stuff in setting like privacy so is not that great for younge people with parents who don't understant technology. Maybe if you add a thing like where someone submits there age and there younge it a simplified version for settings
1697,1698,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Isa Dlt,"I love this app it's a great place too get your mind off of things, there is also a wide variety of games too chose from, roleplay, obbys, simulators, and more! I also love too make friends and chat with people, sometimes I die from laughter because of the chat! Though there is one issue lately there has been a lot of laggs, people getting banned for no reason, and people getting hacked. It has been going on for quite sometime, I think Roblox needs to fix this issue, But overall I love the app!"
1698,1699,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,4,Kade,"Roblox is a good game if you're looking for friends, but lately it's been bland, If you've been on the app for even a second you know the moderation sucks, but in all honesty it's a pretty fun game , but the playerbase is sometimes very problematic; Roblox is genuinely a fun experience and social game, could be better if they weren't getting rid of R6. This is a fun game to hang out with friends and family!"
1699,1700,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Soumitra Bhattacharyya,"This game hang so much but this game is amazing and I love that it is an arcade game and contains of action, horror, comedy, romance each and everything is available here thats I love this game and we really reallly miss the old off sound but the new sound is not that bad in my point of view. I recommend to update more features. With thanks, Your faithfully gamer, Random"
1700,1701,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,A Google user,This game is amazing to play and I feel like it's very graphic and the quality is very good Not only that it's that there's so many games in one download alot of kind people on roblox and I think it's a kind of intermediate to be able to go on any game and just play with no stress but when you do it's better than amazing And if you have someone else to play with you can race them to the end of a certain game of your choice so you can just enjoy the games stress relieved So I think 10/10
1701,1702,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Fear Thefluff,"Alot had changed with Roblox since I've started playing, changes of avatar designs, tons of new games, new death sound ETC. I really enjoy the game! The constant lag is not enjoya le but I think the large variety of games that are less laggy makes up for that."
1702,1703,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Amarin Pantanapichet,"Its really fun but there are a deacent amount of bugs and glitches, like if your jumping for a long time and you let go it will keep jumping. Also if you are walking it randomly starts keep going and you have to reset."
1703,1704,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Layla Welch,I have had Roblox ever since I was a little kid and I loved it because you could play games with your friends all u have to do is send them a friend request and make friends so like then you can just play with them.Join their game you can just have fun. But things I don't like about this game is that sometimes it kicks you out of the game and whenever you disconnect from the internet on accident or you lose a little bit of Wi-Fi and games will not load all of the time.
1704,1705,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,3,Sophia*Joy C-C,"I gave this a 3 star because a lot of mobile players has experience a big problem here. however, this game is really fun and I like it. The camera is always stuck and I experience it several times. You have to probably press a button or leave for that to be fixed. Toxic players and ODers are ruining it. The new update is worst and people hate the new OOF sound which sounds like an anime girl. but this game is my liking."
1705,1706,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Sharon Martin,"The App is amazing. But the only bad thing I can say is the fact that I met a mind blowing jerk. I'm very honest and so down to Earth!! I am an older woman, disabled due to a tragic accident. Had a TBI to an extreme degree! I thought I met an Angel sent from God. He played the part very well! He followed me for months! However it changed my life. I had purpose again. Well he wound up breaking my Heart!! I still love the game!! It's amazing for adults too!! Just like everything internet has some connection problems but for the amount of people that play the game its not all that bad. Nothing is perfect!!"
1706,1707,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,3,Karen Rivera,It's an awesome game it has a lot of exciting things to have and it is really quick sometimes in joining a server. But it's very glitch especially when I play roblox on my phone and sometimes it kicks me so I have to rejoin. It's sometimes very difficult to join a server but if the game loads Its very enjoyable.
1707,1708,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,5,Ivan Danganan,"Really great app I like how there's so many games that I could play with although it's a big buggy sometimes and the gameplay lags but all in all it is a great app and definitely worth to download, this apo can be enjoyed by multiple person at a time but one thing is pls fix like the bugs on avatar. That's all thank you!"
1708,1709,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,4,Abbey Joan,"This game is extra making me happy! But I want to friend lots of people, but it's max limit 200! That's okay, I still love this and I love the part when there are new updates in games! But can you make Robux a little bit cheaper? But thanks for making this game toooooooo much extreme, my favorite is Zombie Attack, Brookhaven, and Tower defense simulator, thanks for reading my review, I hope you have a bright day, bye!👏👋👍 And also, please make the eugh into oof again, we miss the oof sound"
1709,1710,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,YS RIN,"This game is so fun! At first I thought this game is boring since its for kids..BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY GOOD AND FUN.I just have a bit of a problem, my problem is when you go to the shop where you buy stuff for your avatar, it lags like 15 minutes of looking at the shop then it will go to my homscreen when it starts to lag :((("
1710,1711,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Usman Umar,"The game is very relaxing and enjoying, never played a game with the things we want like roleplay with friends and much more. But the problem is the screen glitchs every time during playing."
1711,1712,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,el,"i love this game, play it on mobile and pc, and bought robux on multiple occasions. only real complaint i have is that whenever i'm on mobile my game often crashes. during play through and just on the app designing a character ect. its really annoying."
1712,1713,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,5,Chanel Song,Its a fun game for kids/adults (if they wanna play) everyone loves Roblox! But we miss the oof sound. When you would die as in the game there would be an oof sound we all got connected to that sound but now it's replaced by a sound that goes DUH! We loved the oof sound but it's gone. This is all I'm going to write if you think this is interesting you can download it now! And experience it!
1713,1714,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,MeleeUser,Great game but it bugs out and you can only zoom in and out. The radio passes were pretty muchtaken away bc we cant play what we want inatead we get to pick some from a preset list. I didnt spend over 3k robux on radio passes to pick from a lreset list.
1714,1715,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Daniel Bruce,I love the game! robux is so cheap its really a fair price! and not to mention how fun all the games are. though theirs a glitch. sometimes when i buy robux it disapears and sometimes it can be super laggy. other than that its a good high quality game and the bug updates really been helping alot with lag recently! BUT PLEASE BRING BACK OLD OOF SOUND IK ITS COPYRIGHTED BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE MINECRAFT ENDERMAN
1715,1716,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Ramel Anthony Palomo,Hi i have been playing this game for a while now its a good app but i keep encountering these 2 bugs 1 the screen suddenly shakes and when u try to look around u can only see at the bottom 2 sometimes when i play a game for like 45 minutes when i try to look around it wont let me it only zoom's out and in pls fix this because its driving me crazy
1716,1717,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,Lamya Lami,"It's the best game EVERR! Just two bugs I think you should fix. My first one is, When I want to check, like let's say how much people are in my sever. So I press the Roblox button in the corner, then when I press resume when I start walking, the screen moves on its own. Second, In Brookhaven, there is a t shirt that is like a fire kinda crop top with shorts and the same fire design, but when I press it takes all my clothes off. Other than that I think Roblox is the best. 😁"
1717,1718,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,jill pursell,"This is a good game, but there is quite a lot of lag/glitches. I think this might be my computer, but when I type in anything. Chat, numbers, etc. I can't move. Besides when i'm not playing a game. Also, when I report someone who is doing something rude/innapropriate, I get banned half the time. All in all, pretty fine game, and am looking forward to bigger and better games."
1718,1719,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Sydney Phillips,"It used to be 5 stars but I just can't keep it there. They used to be so great but the community and game is just degrading every update, honestly I don't know if I can play it in a few years with how it's going. I'm just not putting it below 3 stars because of the memories I've made with it for the past 7 years."
1719,1720,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,2,Rhett Akins,"The password reset is not immediate for mobile users who have to use the app, meaning that people will reset there password multiple times before giving up on the app or waiting on it. Also when I log out of my account to play on another it always tells me my password is wrong when I try to log back in. Please fix , then I'll bump up my rating."
1720,1721,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,5,Nsresh Babu,This game has everything you want to play it is good but it does have some bugs. The wallhop system. the game is so great. I love the wallhop system. Definitely a 10/10 for me. The graphics is also nice. With the shaders it's even better.
1721,1722,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Ruby Colman,It is a really good game but for servers if you want a really small server just so you don't have to scroll all the way down make options at the top say smallest and biggest because when I want a small server I have to scroll down a lot and bug fixes
1722,1723,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,4,Lynne Evans,"This game is amazing, so many mini games to choose from. Thrilling! there are soo many different genres of games e.g Horror, fantasy adventure etc. I like roblox because although it's fun it also has safety features such as chat being turned off and hashtags over curse words. Although one thing is, is that over random words it hashtags out like the word 'you' and more."
1723,1724,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Liam Mc gloin,"Roblox is a great game to play ,but as it requires internet I always find it annoying to not be fit to play offline ,other than that there is no problem with roblox,but yet again if it had no need of internet usage it would be a far better experience in my opinion but also maybe lower the cost of robux as it's quite annoying it being so expensive I mean 10.99 is alot for just 800 so that could make an improvement though u have a complaint about this app I still love it and it's my go to app bye!"
1724,1725,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,1,Kee,"The continuous and instantaneous of failed teleportation is both an annoyance and disappointment. I caught wind of knowing Roblox being most wealthiest and always engrossing towards collaboration, never once was there any given nurture to the system. If you may be so kind as to take a closure inspection, gameplay wouldn't even be stifling your projects either way."
1725,1726,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Queen Amathela Inguito,"I've been playing this for years now. So far, nothing's changed, It's still pretty enjoyable. Everything's good, I might even say they don't need to improve 'cause it's already perfect. There's just this update that I didn't like. When they changed the 'oof' sound effect. It's not really a big deal, it just seems kinda off. I've gotten used to the 'oof' sound by now and I think it was just perfect for the game. I really didn't see how it needed to be changed. But it's fine the game's good so far"
1726,1727,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,3,qualyn lewis,It's ok but it lags to much when ever someone does something AWESOME ⭐it starts to lag I was playing these 2 goku games but I can't see the buttons and on the other game I can see the buttons but I can't transform it really annoying that is why my rate is three stars if it weren't for those things it would be five stars
1727,1728,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Lilly Toca,"I have started in 2022 because I wasn't sure if i wanted to play this. All because of the other ratings, I thought it was a good idea! Theone thing is, is that I'm kind of playing this 247 so this is not the healthyest. If anyone does read this just know that you probably will spend a lot of money because everything is bacicaly Robux. I still think its really fun because of the mini games inside of the game! I believe you shoud get the app!"
1728,1729,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Dreaditsself,A great and well programed app! It gives its users a great exprierence. Although as a multimillion buisness I feel as if there should be less major hackings/Malfunctions examples are; About a month ago when the chat filter broke. And a few major hackers like 'tubers93' 1x1x1x1 and even the minor ones like Lolet. Its not something I would expect from a app as great as this.
1729,1730,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Doug Kersh,"It's a very good game,though very laggy. It has so many options,how can you be bored? I give it a 5 out of 5 because it's so fun to play. Just one issue: it lags on mobile and sometimes when I press the menu it only zooms in and out. Otherwise it's a great game!"
1730,1731,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Denny Gibson,"I'm addicted to this game. There are a few things I want added/removed from the game. There should be an in game credit from playing games longer the more you get and you can trade them for robux. Roblox studio should be available on ALL devices so I can create my own games (I am on Chromebook). Remove or at least lower the price to make a group to free-10 robux. Other than those, this is a great game and I'd play it for life! 😁 (BTW) There is a Bug where you turn the camera and it only zooms"
1731,1732,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Luna Lol,"I Really Love Playing Roblox alot theres just a few problems one of the problems are that in a few games like Royale high lag alot and sometimes they would crash 2nd thing is that there would be some screen problems like my screen being frozen or it wouldn't move properly, and sometimes i couldn't walk/move, and the Roblox chat system would sometimes hashtag things like when you type something nice it would just hashtag it, please fix these problemsedit: lol nvm i got a PC it doesn't lag anymore"
1732,1733,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Derek Tay,"Awesome game with tons of cool experiences they have tycoons, stories, obbys, anything you can imagine this is a great game. Only thing that needs improvement is that sometimes the lag can be really bad, but overall, good job!"
1733,1734,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,ev v,"Amazing game, has a huge selection of games to play, safechat is always enabled and not any innaporiate games or any huge concern! I reccomend this game if anyone wants to explore a new world! One thing I wish they would fix is getting rid of all of the classic things and banning random people account, other than that is pretty good!"
1734,1735,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,5,Monica Myles,"World blogs is the best game, if I had to give roadblocks, these points I'll give this roadblocks at 10 hour 10. It's amazing, it's fun, you could decorate you build, you could take care, sir, and it's not too bad."
1735,1736,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,4,Glenda Parker,This game has tons of experiences to play with friends and family it is very fun yes but there are some bugs and glitches which I hope would get fixed they normally only happen to me on mobile but sometimes they'll happen when I'm playing on my computer the reset won't do anything it won't let me move or jump and it jumps like 2 mins later I still love this game though I've grown up on it.
1736,1737,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,Xeno Dan,"The app is good and the games is good , but what I don't really like about is the network issue even though I have a very good and stable connection it lags and say connection error I really hate it specially if I'm grinding levels on a game and it just disconnects, I hope this issue will be fixed because it really makes me mad"
1737,1738,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Ava Jeanie,It is a pain to play certain games on different devices and there are so many bugs and issues with security. If you can see past those then the game is great.
1738,1739,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Jamie Petrar,"Love it! It's a great app for anybody, and really entertaining. I do have some things that are interesting that roblox is doing, which is taking away R6 (soon), Changed death sound, add voice chat (13+), having roblox event with premium in order ro get an item (fixed, but still strange), and lack of promo codes! I personally, miss promo codes. Everyone would get so excited over them and this year they did none so far! The events shouldn't be a replacement for promo codes. Bring them back please!"
1739,1740,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Forest Smith,I love this game it's great for making friends and playing with friends there's endless things to do but at times passwords don't work for some reason and I've almost gotten locked out many times and prices to decorate your character get expensive so I give it a 4 star review
1740,1741,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Jenniebean,It's so addictive.So when you first join your either a girl or a boy the only way to get items for your character is to buy robux with real money it's a little expensive but I think it's worth it.right now I've been playing it for about 1 or 2 years Its super fun my favorite is royale high even though you have to work for your items it's super fun and adopt me is to you ca. RP(role play) and get pets you can trade and do other things.
1741,1742,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,3,Giuliana Brenes,"To be honest I love this game but your account gets hacked very easily and you will have to make a new one like i did but besides that it is really nice a i kinda got addicted to it but it doesnt affect school grades, ur attention in many things, and some games help you. So, i really reccomend and u make a lot of new friends! but dont agree to meet the IRL bc many old people like to kidnnap them and so dont give away any personel info. but its really fun! so I totally reccomend it."
1742,1743,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,km adams,"i love this! its the best game ever, i love it. you can play various games, like alot. over 1m games! theres no reason to give this 1 star. and some devices have funny glitches that are unique! i love it. i hope this is helpful, if you have not downloaded roblox, download now! bet you will love your adventure! bye!"
1743,1744,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Anaya Lizzabeth,"I love this game! It's very fun and there are millions of different games to play! Lots of categories, for example: Survival, there are tons and tons of games to play in just that category! I grew up on this game, and I will never care if people tell me to stop playing it because ""I'm too old"" I will play this game until I die. Also if you can't find a good game without adds, here you go! You can even make your own games! Within roblox of course, but still! Maybe for b-day we can auto hav 100rbx"
1744,1745,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Abi I,It is fun but it is also toxic and dangerous. I say this because there are many hackers and scammers and bully's. There are many people who make bad games and find ways to get through the chat sensors. Overall it is fun if you are carful. So please play carefully and use report if this happens. I do think it is a good game if you stay safe on it. I play almost every night with my friend. It is so fun.
1745,1746,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,3,Nourn Pich Moniroth,"Explain this: I enable voice chat and then I go to play a game that have voice chat but I didn't hear anyone speaking all I heard was the background music. And I only saw theirs microphone open and they SPEAK but I didn't hear them. Oh and when I unable my voice chat then I tried to enable my voice chat again,it won't let me instead it pop up some thingy. I use Huawei tablet."
1746,1747,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,3,Sailor Emma,"It's a great game overall, But I had a few problems. First of all, Poor moderation. Most of the time I find underage people dating older people, and then I see people getting banned/terminated for petty reasons. Then, I see toxic people, fights, and disgusting games, or even inappropriate shirts! I don't see the reason why Roblox allows this, if someone should make a game for everyone, then do it right. It's a ""okay"" game, they just need to do something about this."
1747,1748,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,1,J,Fix the connection problem!!!. When you lost signal for 1 seconds it will force you to leave the game to reconnect it's always a hassle. Let the players stay in server don't force them to leaves to reconnect. Or at least put a timer before kicking you in the server when you lost signal
1748,1749,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,4,death strike,"Would've been perfect but the bugs just sux, when you are walking and you tap the menu, the screen will suddenly follow your joystick, and when you are moving your screen and tap the menu, the screen wont turn which will ruij the experience for when you are having fun with random, there's alot of mobile bugs hut currently this is the major bug for mobile, fix it and most people will be happy and youll rise more."
1749,1750,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,Bexley Arthur,I ♥️ playing Brookhaven with my friend Rory. And I think it is teaching me a lot. It is fun and interesting to KIDS! PLAY IT NOW!!!but when I updated the app I uninstall some games but when I press done it makes me uninstall more! IDK what is happening with my iPad! Help me!!!
1750,1751,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Joanne Wright,"As you can tell 7 year old kids get addicted to this game I've ben playing for 5 years and its still good but the longer you played it for just makes it a little more boring. Also this game is getting packed with all types of anime games and I do not watch anime and Roblox Studio scripting is just so confusing cause you cant just write ""Start the game"" you have to put like 150 lines to like make somewpthing very useless and loads of good games just don't get famous and things like ""Adopt me"" do"
1751,1752,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,5,Cameron Jacobs,"This game is so lit, I've played ever since I was 7. The thing that I like about it is that there Is no type of game you can't find, fighting, anime, shooter, every thing is there, it's a very addictive game, there's something for everyone, and that's what i like the most. Roblox just needs to make it so that more games are accessible to console and mobile. Other than that great game."
1752,1753,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,3,Lillian Dalmau,"This app is great with huge variety of games, but my son plays on the computer everytime he plays and for the last year and a half he has this ""walking glitch"". This means that his avatar keeps on running or walking even though he is no longer pressing the arrow buttons in the keyboard. We have contacted support multiple times. They suggested uninstalling and reinstalling roblox. I have done everything including restored my system to factory settings and the walking glitch is still happening."
1753,1754,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Lexianne Benjamin,"Well about the bugs in this game... I can help u how to stop them! But not permanently fixed okay.... If the ""jump glitch"" happen... Just click the roblox icon in the above left corner... If this things happen again u should do the same thing i told u... Ok next ""zooming screen""... This glitch happen while the game is starting and u just simply double press the screen... If this happen... u don't have any choice but to rejoin it... Ok that's all bye!"
1754,1755,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,5,Md isaac Uddin,It is a very good game which has kept me playing since 2016. It has so many types of different games from obstacle courses (obbys) to role playing games. You can also customise your avatar and make your own games! Unfortunately though you can only make games on a computer.
1755,1756,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,Alice Mottram,Roblox is an AMAZING game. I have played it since 2015 and never uninstalled it. Sometimes it's just a bit slow loading and you can't play it without WIFI but apart from that its REALLY good. I recommend this to everyone.
1756,1757,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Natalia Uribez,"I really like the game but i have little siblings and people are scaring them with the ""hackers"" and there is a lot of od (online dating) which really makes me mad. And then there is this game that you join and your account gets hacked and deleted and we've already lost an account for that. but overall i'd give it a 4 because the games are really fun and a small feature i like is that you have various options for your joystick type. thats really it"
1757,1758,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,5,Maan Singh,Excellent game the graphics are good and the world's are awesome my favorite one is Blox fruit the only problem is that when you have too much data on a world it starts lagging sometimes overall it's an extremely amazing game .
1758,1759,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,4,Nunii,I love roblox but there is some problems with this app. Like I sometimes get disconnected for no reason even when I have great signal. And also when I join certain games my computer will glitch out and crash. I try those games on my phone and it does the same thing. Otherwise this app is great. It will entertain anyone for hours and fun to play with friends. Besides the bad things its a great app. :)
1759,1760,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,1,Cameron Smith,theres a bug where i keep playing games and i close the game and next mintute i want to play it makes me in a pose where everytime i turn the the character has his back turned i dont why it keeps doing that i check to see if there is something wrong with setting but when i look nothing is wrong with it then i have to delete the game and downloaded agin can you please fix this.

1760,1761,2022-07-14,2022,07,14,3,Venolicious,"This multiple game platform is the perfect place for your kids, but sometimes it can be quite frustrating to launch the app. My son has told me that the app doesn't load properly and you would need to reload the app to make it load properly. And in some rare cases the app just doesn't respond at all even when he reloads it. But overall this app is a fun and great experience for my child."
1761,1762,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,5,gab,"This is game is so much fun and I play it all the time, but I think it would make it better if it had the graphics of a computer to make it even better and a lot more smooth to play on because some games are pretty high graphics and lag so if you added this plugin there wouldn't be even a lag spike."

I have a friend that contacted you guys about his password and I am trying to get his account back for him but nothing is working. He had bought things I this game so you guys should be able to see it. If you add the forget password option I will change my post back to a 5 stars, and make sure it is on xbox too. Thanks for understanding"
1763,1764,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Anna BC,"Its a fun game. But though, the problems are roblox is like too popular so... and now there are a lot of online daters. And thats my problem they always ruin my roleplay in brookhaven! One giy was chasing once. He was propably an online dater. And by the way i saw on youtube that meepcity is ruined by online daters. Plus there are lots of bullies. But over all its a great game."

1765,1766,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,3,Amika Marchan,Overall it is a fun game however can't play most of the time. It cuts of after one minute After logging in many days i can not get access to use this app. Worst experience. If i am successful and get to play one of the hundred games available the game and the entire app cuts off after Every Ten minutes!!!!!! Sad because i really love when i am able to play these games😭
1766,1767,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,2,Fleming Family,I experience the same glitch! Every now and then something happens in game and I can no longer move around. When I try to move the camera zooms in and out. It's so frustrating because I have to leave the game and restart in order to correct it.

She learned her typing, spelling and communication skills in these games. Also, she must perform many tasks in real life to be a good girl in order for me to buy her some robux! Parents should download Roblox and give it a try."

I am uninstalling it and reinstalling to hopefully be able to get the symbols up by the chat back, I am dissapointed you can't scroll without a mouse and that in adopt me the bubble won't appear above my head. Otherwise roblox is super fun!"
1770,1771,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,mollie barrett,"this game is really good but it takes ages to download. has amazing games such as tower of parkour adopt me brookhaven royal high flag wars bed wars and way more fun games. robux, robux you have to pay for an ridiculs price from £5 to £100 and some people cant afford it. so yeah but can buy a lot of stuff its really fun but can make a addiction that can be bad its really fun and from 4-any age can play and have fun with it and create your own imagion. Im 10 and is this is my review on roblox."
1771,1772,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Antonia Vlad,"I was trying to buy some Robux, but for some reason nothing worked. It kept saying to set up the play store and I don't know why. Maybe this is a bug or glitch, but it would be really nice if y'all can fix it. Great game, though."

I'm really hoping that you can fix this little bug since I genuinely like the game I have had the game since 1/7/19"
1775,1776,2022-06-25,2022,06,25,4,Dazie Salinas,Really good app there are so many games to play and you can edit your own character how ever you want. I gave it 4 stars only because it winn disconnect me for no reason or when you try to move sometime it will only let you zoom in and out. This is not the games fault but there are so many scammers then there used to be and hackers.
1776,1777,2022-06-01,2022,06,01,4,Emi,"I love roblox, it is easy to play and there are no ads. Robux can be a bit expensive sometimes, but thats okay. I dont have much storage space left so every time theres a update, i have the get rid of so much. sometimes its laggy but that can be fixed. There are SO MANY games to chose from! But, people can sometimes be rude. Also, when you report someone it doesnt really do anything... But anyway, its a great game! And a great way to play with friends online."
1777,1778,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,3,"CABADING, EIRIN JANELLE, F.",It's nice but I have a problem whenever I try to change my perspective or like change sides or something WAAHHWAHHWHW it only zoom in and out which is really annoying and i have to rejoin the server/game because of that:))
1778,1779,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,5,Tamalia King,This game is AMAZING its wonderful but the only thing I don't like is when I join in a game and it always boots me out it's says the connection failure at first I thought it was just me and I saw other people saying the same exact thing so I hope that doesn't happen again. B u t overall it's an AMAZING game.
1779,1780,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Jindo Estabillo,"I like this game,millions of worlds to play with.However theres some bugs that makes me mad or annoyed,for example when i open roblox sometimes it says connection error even i have a good wifi,the camera also glitched and its so annoying,so i""ll rate this 3 stars.

Because theres alot of bugs sometimes the screen doesnt move and the screem only moves forward and back i really dont like it and when i play after sometime i currently comeback to the loading i hate it very much. and people there are rude they make fun of bacons but its still cool i guess.

I joined 2 yeard ago and I love it so much. I play it when I can! Roblox is such a fun game!

I hope everyone enjoys this game as much as I do. My favorite game is bloxburg."
1784,1785,2022-07-04,2022,07,04,5,Mike Cole,"This is a great game, but unfortunately it has some super annoying bugs. Especially on mobile it might exit the game completely (not the tab for the app though) or if you accidentally put three fingers on it, the game will glitch and you can only zoom in and out. This is the majority of my annoyances but overall is a great game one of every downloaders absolute favourites (be warned you can get a bit addicted) but that's for the better as roblox has a extremely wide range of games."

You should fix the bugs and also fix the site. 2, Appeals don't work at all. If you send an appeal it WON'T do anything. I suggest you to really fix that. I got banned for something I didn't even say, and yet you guys haven't given my account back. I sent only ONE appeal just like they told me to. AND NOTHING!!!"
1787,1788,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,2,Michael Wilkerson II,"Really good game. The reason for 2 stars is because, well there was this player. He would not stop useing this gun to freeze me. I asked him to stop and he still whent on with the gun. So i got mad and said that he cant play without his gun. I also said to rep him for doing it.( reporting system is also messed up) Then out pf the blue i was banned. Roblox fix this!"

Still a good game though doesn't really change the fun but I'm kinda scared if it will because I heard the roblox was going to change the whole game to that new update. So far so good, but not so about roblox's future. Recomend this game, not if you don't want this to be to accurate to real life. Great game though fun worlds to explore you can never get bored while playing roblox.😍"

It's not like before, even if my internet connection before is kinda slow, when i play a game it's still fast to enter, and it's so laggy but when i quit the game my internet connection is strong. And i wish you could just put a button where to give robux easily to someone:)) tyy that's all."

It is so laggy when your trapped you have to reset the character so you can be out but the game will start from the first. 2. This is the worst case that you have update it every month 😒, and I don't have that much space to download it every time you should make a download maybe every year so you can make all the 12 month changes in one time update😑😑."
1795,1796,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Tanisha Baker,This is an opinion but I hate when I play a game and it makes everything invisible . It's very annoying because I have to rejoin even if I'm playing with friends:(( . Edit: good game tho I started in like 2019 but had to remake accounts !!

You can design your character the way you want to with little or no robux and most of the people are pretty nice, but there are allot of online daters and just mean people so if you are wanting to install the game and your sensitive to that just be careful for them. Other then that it's a pretty good game and you should think on installing it! :)"

1802,1803,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,3,Jordan Mills,Would rate higher if it wasn't for the MULTIPLE glitches that roblox has. One of the most annoying is that if I play more than two games then my character forcefully turns everywhere my camera turns. At random times I can only zoom in and out and not turn. Among many others!
1803,1804,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Cartoon Autopsy,So I think this game is pretty good so fair but if you play on iOS or android it glitches a lot unless you have some sort of like router or something but it's a good game in these hard times and this game is letting people have fun when they're scared. Also it only glitches on those if you have a old computer tablet or phone.
1804,1805,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Victoria Cruz,All the games are fun but there are a few problems 1. Sometimes I glitch out of the world 2. I get kicked out of the games for no reason 3. When I accidentally press the roblox logo in game and then I zoom it just zooms me up and down. these are all the problems I hope you guys fix theses bugs or glitches

And you could chat with friends but over all it is a really good game my brother plays it all the time and i would give 5 star if it doesn't have exploits or rude people. AND THE GAME IS LITERALLY FREE NO ADDS."

If you see this game please install it it will be the best choice of your life 4/5 keep up the good work and try to fix the controls!

This game has tons of things to do, and besides the usual scams and lags every once and a while, there's nothing wrong with it.

Only more bugs are presented, like the shift lock button and the camera issue still hasn't been fixed."
1817,1818,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Nina White,This game is really cool and I like the dress up aspect of it and some of the games that you can play like roleplay or K-pop games are really good. But Roblox does have a problem with reporting some stuff like I got sexually harassed and called a racial slur in a server and then I got banned so I think we're Roblox could work on that. It's really good other than those problems and it's nice to play with friends especially in horror games.
1818,1819,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,5,Archie Zamora,"This game is very enjoyable but it has issues to, we all know all the games have issues even the bestest games. I only have 1 issue when im playing some games my screen sometimes lag but its kinda not a phone problem its the game when i try to move it, it zooms in/out or even sometimes it can't be moved. Tht is the only issue that i have a problem with."
1819,1820,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Victor Sunday,"This is so good. When I play Brookhaven, it can dress me up. Except the Headless Head.and it's so good. Good thing you made this game! It's kinda boring, robux scams too. Sorry for it but it's nice, and please put the old ""oof"" sound, and there is a glitch. When I put shift lock, and leave the game with it, and I join a game, it be like shift lock! Pls remove that glitch."
1820,1821,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Shyla Knudsen,"Even though it does cencore some things you say this game is very good, you can play with friends, meet new friends, adventures, survival, horror and even more are contained in this game that I have enjoyed."
1821,1822,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,4,Jun Lawagan,"Hey roblox! Big fan for your community but can you fix this bug lately? When i join a game a black screen is there for 1-9hours and I've been waiting 4 whole hours roblox. 4 WHOLE HOURS!, now this bug makes mobile players go crazy, like when they open the menu it sometimes break our camera like when you zoom in it zooms out when you zoom out it zooms in, like what?! Fix this bug but I'll give this bs a solid 4 stars"
1822,1823,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,TechnoFox,"Roblox is a fun and awesome game but theres some issues. For starters, the community. There may be a chat filter but some people can be toxic and some games are very offensive. Also, theres a bug on mobile where it zooms in and out when i try to move. The only way to stop it is by leaving. I think many people have experienced this to. Roblox please fix this. But besides that its really fun and i recommend playing it."
1823,1824,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,Breanne Knox,I love this app I even grew up playing it. But I do have some small issues. Like I have had the account for awhile I even put robux on it. But if you don't have the same Gmail you had before you can't log back in. Which has been stressing me out a lot.. and when you spen some robux on items and they get deleted that's really all. But overall it's amazing!
1824,1825,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Daisy D,"My fave game with so many amazing experiences and something for everyone! 🥰 although, I do wish that u didn't have to pay for robux and that u could save game progress on roleplay games and obbys so u could continue from where u left off. My only issues and aren't that much of an issue anyway."
1825,1826,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Elly Dedmon,Its a great game but it needs some work. Like when i was in the game brookhaven it eould always kick me out and say to reconnect. I also think that sometimes people say things they shouldnt and makes the game full of bullies on some servers not all though.
1826,1827,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Charlie Ogley,This game is amazing! Its kept me occupied when I've been bored. Sometimes people are rude and its just annying which knocks off a star but some people are nice and they help you with things that you don't really know what to do on that game if there is not a tutorial but overall after that disadvantage I would give it 4 stars and a rating of 8 1/2 out of 10. But this was a very good experience that I have had since when I joined it has been good I would say. Sorry for how long this is. XD
1827,1828,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,•sleepy_bri monkey_Amanda•,I love Roblox it is a really fun game but there's a few problems sometimes your account can get hacked but that never really happens that often but some people have games and stuff but I still give it up five out of five cuz they are so much games to play on Roblox Roblox is a really fun game to play I think you should try it if you never played it before all my favorite games are bloxburg. A hospital. Adopt me. Murder versus sheriff. But all games are really good
1828,1829,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Kathleenarianna Warren,"Roblox is an amazing app! You can play with friends for free, without ads! I know millions of people play this game because how good it is! There are millions of different games you can play, and you can customize your character in your own style! Though it cost robux for most items (in games or for your character) it's so worth it! I would 100% recommend!"
1829,1830,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Isreal Cruz,"I love this game so many things to play all in 1 app! My friends and family enjoy it! It's safe and enjoyable for everyone! Though not many people are safe and date 90 year old :| but it is so fun to play, though 4 star rating is because there is a bug in when I try to play tower of fun, when i enter shift-lock and then turn it off,it makes me still in shift-lock. Still i live this game!"
1830,1831,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,5,Lucy,I play this game all the time So i give it 5 stars but there is a few bugs Do r one sometimes the move button bugs out and just zooms in and out or moves as u walk. And Then sometimes my camera gets suck. And thats bout it! Thanks!
1831,1832,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,3,soup,"its fun and stuff, but censors way too much. you cant even say ""the red"" sometimes which is weird. theres also a glitch where you cant move your screen and it just goes in and out. sometimes when changing your avatar it freezes too. but its good."
1832,1833,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,2,Powerful Smore,Love the app but some games are just unplayable for me. My screen will break making it impossible to move my camera. Only way to fix is to rejoin. And in some cases that makes you lose progress which is so irritating... Besides that the game is great.
1833,1834,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,AshK The One and Only,"Its the best game. But there is a problem, I got logged out of my acc since it says that the same account has been launched on a different device. So I changed my pass but now I keep putting in the pass I changed it to and the exact same user it keeps saying incorrect, now I decide to use the email to send instructions. It wont even send what I have to do... I keep refreshing, exiting, and logging in and out nothing happens. Im stuck logged out of my acc and I am annoyed and dissapointed Roblox"
1834,1835,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,elysiqz,"Really fun to play with friends, amazing game. But you need to pay to get robux for what you need, but some are cheap. But awasome game to play when your bored. I'm so happy I've got this I've made so many moments and made some friends. All these games, history are part of my childhood. The best game I ever had in my childhood life."
1835,1836,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Pintoz Dragon,"One the best games ever. You know those games where in the ads they only show you the minigames? Well Roblox is different. Roblox is a free to play game. There are games in the game. Sometimes there are even games in the games of the games! You can create your own game, send, accept and decline friend requests. It's a great game for all ages but to all parents out there be prepared for your children begging you for Robux, the ingame currency. It's not like any other game I've seen before."
1836,1837,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,don hawkins,"It's a great app, 10/10 would recomend. But since I am a phone user, it lags more often and I can't play as many games as I would want to. And you should be able to earn robux instead of buying it because some people can't aford it. So example if you complete a really hard obby like Tower of Hell, you should earn 10-30 robux."
1837,1838,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Glen Bartek,Sometimes the game lags for no reason and I'm gone for a long time just for a little bit then it starts lagging and I can't even move my screen all I can go is just have to turn my own cariter to just see what happens it lags a lot but it's a pretty good game and there's so much world to explore I love this game so much but it's not just right because it starts lagging but ether then that i love the game
1838,1839,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,4,Jiten Prasad,"Roblox is totally amazing but the one little thing that bugs me is that when you're playing a cart ride game, people are absolute MEANIES BRO!!! Like I'm trying to dance in Rdites head and all of a sudden someone stands in my way and makes me go off track!!! ITS SO DAMN ANNOYING (also the fact that when I report someone it doesn't work half the time 😒). That's all!! (This review isn't a bad one btw it's just things that bug me, I would recommend downloading it when you're bored lol)"
1839,1840,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Fred Lewis,its so fun u can make make friends and learn stuff. one bad thing is there is a lot of hackers and scammers so i think they need some more sucurity so ur account is safe!And mabye add a few things that dont cost the ingame money so all the people that dont want to spend money on ingame cash have at least a few good options.
1840,1841,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,Edgar Karam,This is a good game and it's a game full of adventure but the thing that makes me mad is that the connection is slow sometimes so the thing i would love as an uptdate is if it would not need wifi for the game. Also.... Idkw but I can't update it!
1841,1842,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Stranger things,I recommend this app but the reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because there is a few glitches and bugs for example it logs you off your account and disconnects you for no reason but overall I think this is a great app and once you install this you get addicted! I hope this helps so you can descover a new game on Roblox that you will get addicted too!
1842,1843,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,GachaLife4Life,"This game is amazing! It's so entertaining and some of the games are really high quality! You can play with your friends and make new friends, though there are complications, like bluring out chat that arent bad. Its quite frustrating but overall a good game!"
1843,1844,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,4,Animelover_IB3 Animelover_IB3,"This game is really great but there some things in the game not meant for kids..for example, there are gore, blood, LGBTQ, And maybe games that are meant for adults, even if it a kid game, and it's for people of all things and these have NOTHING to do with the game what so ever however the game is really really fun to play with in a way however there are a couple bugs, overall really good game :D"
1844,1845,2022-07-04,2022,07,04,5,Aidan Kisbey-Green,"Very nice game platform, I have played it from laptop to Chromebook to iPad, but the Chromebook version doesn't run so well. Recently my core UI dissapeared, so I re-downloaded Roblox and it was back, but then it dissapeared again and it didn't come back when I re-downloaded it again. Just now I was playing a game and the app just restarted, so I opened it again, but it would crash every time I tried to rejoin, and now I opened it and it crashed, keeps happening, idk why though."
1845,1846,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Rebecca Youens,"Amazing, such fun, so many games to choose from and it's great you can play with your friends and chat to them although it is a hastle to get robux and different characters but I am absolutely delighted with the experience!"
1846,1847,2022-08-06,2022,08,06,1,Chris Medway,I think it's a wonderful game! . 1 I hate it when your skin you have to get robux to get a new asome skin how annoying. 2 when you go and put three fingers your screen will glitch and you go to turn your screen it will go up or down.3you can't play all the games some cost robux.😶sad but it's an asome design the whole game is so fun!!!!!!!🤩🤩😁
1847,1848,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,spinning cat kitty,It's very fun and has many games to play on like adopt me or jail break but my one complaint is that it is harder to play on mobile because sometimes when your walking you just stop moving and you can't do anything also some times there might be a delay on jumping but still I recommend the game
1848,1849,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,5,Mini Miniz,"I really love this game, I start played this game since 2020 and until now the issue is still same. Screen broken. But for me it's just a normal issue, but when I played games that cannot save what we played, II'll be frustrated. Roblox. Please fix it"
1849,1850,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Alex -,"Thsi si a game with LOTS of games on them , Roleplaying , Among us Knock offs , Even fornite knocks off , obbys , Horro Games , Horro storys , Board games for some reason. Ive been playing for abotu 5 or 4 years. And i love it. But it didint give a 5 star because there is a bit issues by example sometimes it dosent show that my friends are online when they really are online. And Sometimes Loading in the game it takes a bit of time or i hvae to uninstall it and reinstall it to make it work."
1850,1851,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,Fnaf_cutevanny,I love this game so much because I have a lot of games I meant a tons there's like 1 million or more like I been playing this since I was little this is so fun I hope you will like it too and please please please please play this game cuz it's a really good game plus there's fashion show showsyou can make your own game plus you can take care of your own character it's so fun place to go buy stuff from the game but it's still fun and make new friends. This game is for girls and boys anybody.
1851,1852,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,5,deeznuts,"I love this game a lot. I really enjoy everything there is lots of games you could ever choose from, and it has no ads which is what I like the most. But the report thing does nothing. People may be rude and other stuff and sometimes it could be laggy, and some updates also ruin it when people are playing like right now there is something going on with mine. So I just wanted to check it again."
1852,1853,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Sabrina Purvis,I have a problem with my game everytime the update thing pops up it decides it doesn't wanna work I try to update it its a really nice game and I've been playing this game for like 5 years and I grew to love the game but this isty bitsy problem keepes me from playing and I usually play this game alot so if you are able to fix it i would be very grateful and if u can't its fine.😔😔😊😊
1853,1854,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Sofia Alves,"It's good. There is lots of games and you can play anything. (Example Roleplay, Just talking, Horror games, tycoons and much more!) You can even make your own world if you want you can design your own avatar In anyway you want. One thing I really like it that option where you can't swear since it's kids friendly. Kids who are my age tend to swear a lot but it's nice not hearing the f word sometimes lol, and another good thing is that you can find friends and play with them. Great game."
1854,1855,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Cara T,"Roblox is a good game to play, it's usually fun, but their moderators are very bad, and the chat filter needs a fix. Sometimes I can't even say 'what' or 'hello', other times I can. Roblox itself is about a 2 star, but the games players make are usually a 4/5. Robux is too expensive. Otherwise, highly recommend it for playing."
1855,1856,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Olga Holt,"Overall it's pretty good. There's a bunch of games that you can play, probably even more than the human population, but some probelms- Honestly, I don't think 5 dollars is worth only 400 Robux. I'd say 600 - 750 Robux would be a better option. And same for the 10 dollar one. 1300 - 1700, but the 100$ one???!? Its only 10k. I'd say a better deal would be 20 - 30k my other problem is how the friends list work. See, if you don't have a player on you're friends list, you can't message them......I f"
1856,1857,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Morgan Lobsinger,Love the app but yesterday I couldn't get in to play adopt me. After I tryed 2 more times I finally got in. So many different games. edit...i no longer play adopt me due too being scamed from all of my legendary pets.Edit.... after over a year i have started to play adopt me again I regret not playing more in the last year do to pets that are now unavailable that are really hard to trade for
1857,1858,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Niraj Kumar,"Man this is one of the best games I have seen in my life all you need is a good device and Enjoy! And it's also supported for mobile stuff which I like the best, theres only one problem for me that the safe chat should be less strict, because I have even seen that ""ok"" was also hastagged for a long time. by the way it's a great game!"
1858,1859,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,kayedence Baker,Its a good game! But there's a big problem..! Anytime if I try to get off a game on mobile or get on a game.. It just glitches and freezes! One time when I was on a game I was walking and it just froze and put me at the beginning! I hope you can Fix it!
1859,1860,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Marge Gmail Google Acct.,"id rate this 4/5 because it will glich and sometimes disconnect. But it is a very fun game. You can play whith anybody else, and you can costimize your avartar. Also this game requries internet. for some games and for items you do need ""robux""/ acctual money."
1860,1861,2022-07-11,2022,07,11,5,Istiaque Ahmed,"This game is super fun i can play tons of games and change my avatar its very fun i've been playing it for 4 years now, but theres a few problems, the screen gets stuck everytime i press the roblox menu and it glitches alot like when i walk the screen just zoom in and out, and alot more but its super fun and amazing! I'm impressed how much this game is improving and exciting features its gonna have 😄😄"
1861,1862,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Juan Llossas,This game is amazing. There is alot of games and fun stuff in it. Just a few probloms. Sometimes the screen is stuck and only goes in and out but it only happends a few times.
1862,1863,2022-08-15,2022,08,15,5,Sophia,I played this game for like 2-3 years and it's fun but I kinda get bored of it I would really wanna add some things like a few more nice accessories free or not and can you guys fix the screen problems I have been playing in mobile but when I accidentally zoom my screen it will broke and it's kinda annoying but at least it's great just please fix it!

1864,1865,2022-06-20,2022,06,20,2,IDK_TwT,"Idk if its just me but when im on the phone, all the games wont let me play. The game starts but then keeps loading on the black loading screen with the game picture. I checked on the servers on the game and it shows all of the servers full. I've done everything my brain can come up with and nothing works. But it does work on my pc so thats why it's a 2 star."
1865,1866,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,1,Michael Mcrae,It gets super boring after a long time and if you off the app for two seconds you get kicked out of the game immediately and the jump button on the phone is way too small and also there's this glitch where when you get teleported/join a game it closes the game and there's no mobile shiftlock I would probably rate 0 if possible
1866,1867,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Hazel Joyal,"It's a great game! But, I give it 4 stars beacause I lost my account because of a hacker, I still haven't gotton it back. Otherwise, the game is really great, you can make avatars, make new friends, play a ton games people have made, and so much more!"
1867,1868,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Jocelynn Bos,It's soooo dang fun there is so many games to play and you can talk and play with friends you can make new friends and talk it's so fun I just love it so much but I don't really like how you have to get an upgrade no other games have to do that that I've heard
1868,1869,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,Lyla Reale,"This game is extremely fun but I had a problem this afternoon, when I tapped it showed the log in or sign up page when I have had the acc for months and for some reason it won't let me back in. I had so much progress I'm pissed."
1869,1870,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,3,Kara White,"I love the game a lot, it's just that whenever I'm on mobile my screen will sometimes glitch and I either zoom in and out when trying to move my screen side to side, or when I move the joystick the whole screen moves the way I'm moving my joystick, I would really like it if you fixed it roblox! :D"
1870,1871,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,5,Jhenny Gutierrez,This game has a lot of fun and enjoyable games in it. I enjoyed many games in roblox and I have been playing it for almost 4 years. It had many development and updates that I liked and keep getting better. It doesn't have many bugs or error or disturbing things. That's all. I highly recommend this game because it can also improve your skills.
1871,1872,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Lasso Memme,It's been a long time since I've been playing on this app but for some reason when I play on my phone it stops me from playing the game I'm playing and just says launching experience and never does anything. I'm not sure if it's just my phone or it's something that as to do with me playing mobile. But if you could please help me fix it that would be great.
1872,1873,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,5,Bradley Miller,Roblox is a great game. So many different games to choose from and none are exactly the same😀. Plus there is no adverts.i would recommend this game if you have a short attention span because your progress saves. Enjoy yourself and thank you for taking time to read this
1873,1874,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,3,EnderRémie Enderman,"What happen to roblox... it isn't the same anymore, there is alot of bug, launched game problem, loading problem, and so much more! People dosen't appreciate the updates cause it making the game even worse and losing alot of player. And now hackers are online and hack people and you dont ban them. Even oof sound is gone and we loved it. roblox it's in danger! I just dont want to quit playing I'm giving it a chance, everybody deserve a chance. Please fix this when you want. Thank you."
1874,1875,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,5,Demetriah Simpson,This game is a perfect game you can do everything on it it's basically like the best game I ever played sometimes it takes games that I actually play off of this and put them into this that just make me like it even more you should definitely play this game it might take up a little storage but it's worth it so you might want to download it now if you haven't already go ahead and do it and I will see you when you do
1875,1876,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Noah Yeates,This game is amazing me and my brother have been playing this game for years and we still are addicted and the bug fixes improve the game in the ways you didn't even know it could improve. I enjoy playing with my friends we love being able to play together in loads of different games in Roblox. I like how helpful Robux is when I'm stuck in a game when I've spent all my coins and can't progress without using just a bit of Robux. I love how many funny and happy memories I've had on Roblox games.
1876,1877,2022-08-13,2022,08,13,1,Jaime,"The game itself is fun but I've experienced multiple glitches, I've also forgotten my password and tried to reset it but it isn't sending a reset code or email, kind of inconvenient. It also laggs and freezes, disables chat options and locks the screen, as well as removing items from my inventory and I can't get them back unless I leave and re join the game, this is a huge issue."
1877,1878,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,4,A Google user,"I love this game!, But the problems of mine is that there is some games i cant play but it is understandable cause i know its because of my phone there may be a little bugs or glitches but it doesnt bother me at all although sometimes when i try to open the game it wont let me it just says ""Sorry, there was a problem reaching to our servers"" and i have click retry many times until i have to uninstall it and install it again but this game is pretty good i recommend it if you get bored easily"
1878,1879,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Basil Business,"This is a great game. Its entertaining and great to pass the time, it's exciting and full of so many things to do and people to talk with. But there's a few problems you still need to fix. There's too much censoring. I am aware that there are immature people who will speak rudely but I get the word ""I'm coming"" censored, it's ridiculous."
1879,1880,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Celestina Cander,"it's really nice! but in my opinion i think it's better for the robloxians if you would let us rejoin in the same server if we disconnected, and also pls make it easy to load, and please fix the kohl admins problem, and it would be nice if you let us play without internet, im sure everyone will enjoy it ^^ (sorry if im asking to much this is just my opinion!)"
1880,1881,2022-08-09,2022,08,09,5,Joanne Parker,I think Roblox is very good because there's lots of different games to play. You can make an avatar with some things for free and some games let you create a different 1 just for that game. You can also play with friends and you can create private servers so only u and you're friends can play together. You play with other people in the world. It is a great game.
1881,1882,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,4,arianne gubar,"Really great but the only thing is i have 3 complaints.. 1- Whenever i have good wifi it lags and crashes it always says that im getting hacked, But it sometimes happen to everybody ... 2- robux, Soo everytime I have ROBUX, like I said im lag right? its not showing my robux.. It's not bad but I have to restart my phone even if I refresh Roblox IT DOESN'T WORK!! So last thing 3- Some inappropriate games and clothes .. please I'm not hating but those stuffs are bad for kids. Thankss"
1882,1883,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,4,MRFACEPLANT,"Very fun game, especially when you meet someone that actually a good person 👍. Just out of all the 5 years I've been playing Roblox, the game have gotten more toxic and less fun, and last year I switched to playing on PC. This game is a really entertaining online experience! And for some reason 11 people are following me idk why lol."
1883,1884,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,5,Karina Torralbas,"I really like this game, especially mm2 but either sometimes my Internet is really bad or sometimes Roblox is really laggy. Sometimes it takes a long time to load and unfortunately means i have to restart my device, but besides that, I recommend this definitely."
1884,1885,2022-07-03,2022,07,03,5,Worapol Kaewkaow,"The game is perfect, has a lot of experience and even have games to choose from. Roblox is the best place to go and explore and even your imagination. You even can create games, to be honest my favourite feature is The character. If you're finding new games to play, I highly recommend this app."
1885,1886,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Emma Grace Brown,Roblox is great but sometimes whenever it has an update it makes me delete so much stuff and then it won't even let me update it so I have to go and uninstall it then download it over agian and then update 8t and it's a big hassel so can you please fix that issue but other than that it's been and amazing app
1886,1887,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,5,Crk Addict,I've been playing this game for years and I really like it. My only complaint is that sometimes I have beaten every game to death and there is nothing left to play. Usually at that point I don't play for about 1 month until I find something I like to play or is now fun to me. I wish you could rate Roblox games so the best rated ones could be at the top and then it would be easier to find fun and good games to play.
1887,1888,2022-08-20,2022,08,20,3,Shaylee Howard,When I went to buy robux it didn't let me even actually complete the payment idk why cause it's a gift card my friend gave me it has 100 dollars... It says something like 'this purchase was not completed' and even I paid for Minecraft with the gift card and it let me buy Minecraft and I checked my balance afterwards and it was 92 dollars left over as my new balance...I have a Motorola phone but I never had a problem with buying robux on my old old account from 2020.
1888,1889,2022-08-18,2022,08,18,4,Sunaldo Reid,I rly love this game it is one im addicted to. But three glitches makes me hate it when I'm play the catalog avatar game my game would just stuck then I can't get the stuff and have to swipe off the game and this glich is when my screen goes fully black then go on the Roblox front and that will make it never load so I'll have to swipe off the game and the last one is when I try to save a character it said character not loading
1889,1890,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,3,Manveen Rana,"It keeps glitching, it so annoying because As soon as I make a friend the server glitches and kicks me out. Like why???It keeps happening. I have to stop playing for half an hour to stop the glitches.and on top of that my friends get angry that I just left the game. Not only me it happens to every child playing Roblox."
1890,1891,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,Suzanne Wheeler,The best game ever but recently its lately been randomly sending me to the main menu and won't reload and takes forever to to load into a game the screen just goes black and always says that im only in the game when there's thousands and hundreds of people playing the same game i have recently my game fixed itself but is always so laggy it is very annoying
1891,1892,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Jyotsna Baghel,"Best game i have ever played, Amazing experiences, Beautiful graphics, and more, But the reason i gave it 4 stars is because Alot of times, it makes me disconnect for no reasons, makes me lag alot, my wifi is fine, pls try to fix this."
1892,1893,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,2,D D,"Roblox always needs updated! I can never play it anymore! I've ran out of storage and can't update it. It needs updated every single week! I would like if you could please make it so we could earn robux by playing games. If not then please make some items cheaper and the new Adopt Me updates have had really expensive exclusive pets. Also this has just started, but as I clicked the icon to leave the game, it came up to leave at the side of my screen. It's super annoying. Pls remove it. I hate it."
1893,1894,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Toni Alexandra,I like roblox but it is out of control. Sometimes it just randomly logs me out and I have to log back in. Sometimes when I want to join a game it freezes and wont let me in the the game so I have to wait for hours while playing another. It's not cheap and somethings just aren't fair. Last time I lost a device and forgot my password without putting an email on. I couldn't log back in so I had to create another account :/. There are also a lot of toxic people on roblox I don't feel safe on Roblox.
1894,1895,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,HappyDudeSunny,"This game is one of the best games I have ever played in my life, but there is one problem, money. This multi-billion company ""cant afford"" a 10k lawsuit and bring back what everyone wants, the oof sound effect. Robux also is way too overpriced, but over all that, everything about the game is perfect and it is suited for gamers of all ages."
1895,1896,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Mia Chasey,Love roblox 💜! I've been playing it for a few years now. A few reasons why I do is bc I've made so many friends over the years that I talk to every single day. Another thing is that roblox has so so many fun games that you can play. They have such a high variety of games you can choose from.
1896,1897,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Itz._lime I think,"i love the games but the downfall is when i play some games, I'll get taken off of the game after 5-10 mins of playing and im back on the roblox loading screen, so i have to reopen the app. I dont know whats up with it but its pretty annoying at some times."
1897,1898,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Jordan hardesty,Best game ever! You can do whatever you want and so many different things! Like I am insane about warrior cats and there are really no games of warrior cats on play store but on roblox it has a warrior cat game and it probably 80% 9f the time will have what games you looking for! But sometimes it can be glitchy but that don't change anything about this great game! Definitely get it!
1898,1899,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,3,ヅ.Akio.ヅ,"I rate this 3 stars because I can't make hair combos anymore. I love hair combos because I look better with hair combos. Everything else is alright in my opinion, but please let it come back, If you bring hair combos back, yay! Also, I can't make any games anymore because I can't place any items! And I am trying to reach homestead!!! 😿 I updated roblox studios and the same thing happened!!!!!! I don't know what I pressed to make it like this! Tellmewhatto do"
1899,1900,2022-08-03,2022,08,03,2,VZRVARCITY,The Moderation sucks sometimes you can get tagged for saying hey or hi and also I wish you could see the last online date when you click someone's profile also when you exit the players list the dynamic joystick controls mess up the camera so much there needs to be a major bug fix for that
1900,1901,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Sage Haley,this game is great its lots of fun to play ecspecially with friends but sometimes when your in a game the game will just lag for no reason you could have perfect wifi and everythings fine but it still will lag and then you cant even exit the game so your forced to get out of the entire app and this is not just me i know lots of people who have the same problem and its always random its never on a certain game so it cant be a game problem it has to have somthing to do with the app
1901,1902,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,4,Erin Riley,"Would recommend to people who like to build, create, etc. Although sometimes I play a game and when I turn I can't see my face, Can you fix this problem? And while I play a game when I accidentally click the roblox logo on the top left, when I resume it messes up when I walk.And sometimes when I walk in a game when I swipe it messes up FIX IT I GET THIS ALL THE TIME. Also I have a bad feeling you will delete r6. I mean this company will just turn into 'rolife' instead of roblox. :|"
1902,1903,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Haley Mikels,"Awesome, Love the game but there are a couple glitches where I can't move the screen at all and looking at some of the comments it's pretty common, Another glitch, When I'm jumping for a long amount of time it normally doesn't let me stop jumping, So I have to rejoin, Or when I'm on laptop I can't move my mouse at all, I love this game but you need to fix the glitches they've been happening since I first joined Roblox, Overall it's awesome."
1903,1904,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,4,Adrian Montgomery,"Roblox is an amazing game with endless possibilities. It's awesome, excepts for the fact that sometimes it runs really slow, and the updates are very frequent. I'd give it 5 stars if these could be somehow fixed."
1904,1905,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Paola ruiz,I like it because its unlike any other game its so fun too But there is a small issue first of all there was this really weird lag that happened only once when I was playing a game my connection was ok but when I was was walking my character started to walk back and forth all over again nothing I did work I could not control myself I could not leave or anything so I turned my phone off it did not happen until like 6 min into the game but it doesn't happen anymore this game is still very fun!
1905,1906,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Jaymy Taylor,"Super good!!!! Although a couple times i haven't gotten my robux from purchasing. It did quite upset me. I spent a little bit over 50$ on robux for myself. I spent it and it didn't even say ""purchase cancelled"" or whatever, i looked at my paypal balence and 50$ was abducted. I didn't have my robux either. I refreshed multiple times and still didn't get anything. I even restarted my phone. Please fix this. Even tho this has only happened 1-3 times for me."
1906,1907,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Alchemy Coen,"I used to play this game when I was 5, I still love it now that I'm almost an adult. When ever I put on 3D clothing and join a game it doesn't show up. A thing that should be in roblox, we should be able to rate the apps and tell them how good they are or something, like how we are doing now and maybe even for the players. Maybe we could lift the chat rules a little as well but that's ok if we can't!"
1907,1908,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Peyton Hill,"Roblox is my favorite game but I didn't give it 5 stars because there's a bunch of bugs! Only some big ones though,like sometimes I'm playing and it disconnects me when my wifi is fine and sometimes my charecter frezzes and i cant move. Without these bugs this is an awsome game"
1908,1909,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,2,Robin Cheek,"This app is Amazing! But....Right now,I had to update it.It needs updates regularly so I knew what to do. I went into my Google play and then went to roblox and pressed update.But I waited and waited and waited. I waited more than 5 hours. And it was stuck at 43%.It still is. im on a Samsung mobile. Any way how to fix this? If you know how to fix it,please tell me. I may even rate it five stars. Anyway,good app overall. Oh,and I rate it so low because im sad that this is happening.............."
1909,1910,2022-06-12,2022,06,12,5,melissa,"This app is actually not bad, however it acts really bad when i use my phone/mobile , and when i use my computer/pc its completely fine! But when i check the reviews they say the pc and the phone/mobile works perfectly fine so i think its something on how my phone/mobile is just not working for this app. But i still rate it a 5 stars, if this is a bug plz fix it roblox. Thank you for your time! Bye :) and I would also like to say, this game has bad qualities sometimes, please fix that too"

Second is the bug that sometimes happens when logging to roblox. I recommend u fix it and third of all,this robux thing is such a pain because it just a currency that everyone wants it and people don't have such nice things and get bullied because of it. Plz fix it."
1911,1912,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,5,Louise Hankin,It's great! Try it! It includes fun experiences you will get on no other game! Ever since I started playing I've been able to play with friends and use social skills more. There are a few glitches on games but apart from that its my fav game. Honestly when my friends told me about it i couldn't wait to try it out and here i am 4 years of roblox
1912,1913,2022-08-22,2022,08,22,1,Leanne Burr,"There's glitches bruhh roblox really needs to improve and so many it would take hours to explain soo, I think roblox needs to improve straight this moment and this is my favorite game ever but..😶 I love it soo soo soo much love it!!

1914,1915,2022-06-20,2022,06,20,4,Yoanna Ramos,"Roblox is a really, cool and fun game! I play it with some of my friends and cousins! But the reason why I gave it 4 starts is because of the lag, glitches and tags. Sometimes my screen won't move and I can't even type numbers. Also, there are lot of exploiters, hackers, and oders which makes the game kinda annoying. But It's still a cool game!"
1915,1916,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,5,John Parra,I play the game it's great but there are few bugs and glitches. Almost all the time I leave the experience but it rejoins again and now I fight with my phone and computer. So please fix that

1917,1918,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,4,Natasha Andrea Monares,"Very good app but it does need a very good signal in your area bcs if not youll be laggy all throughout the game besides that its has very good video games , really relaxing to play well it does depend on what you're playing but for me it is relaxing to play with and lastly it's very handy bcs its only on your phone so you can play& bring it everywhere you go . This Game is also a place to bond / interact with your friends online. I love the way you can style yourself but it does cost robux."
1918,1919,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,2,Ranz Ileto,1 star for Roblox ( so many bug ) The lagging bug screen bug It's Easy to example First lagging even my connection is good its keep me reconnecting or the other player won't move at all and second screen bug It's like u can't swipe it's or Move it's!!

1921,1922,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,4,Adam Finley,"I love this game I can play it. I do RECOMMEND this game because. You can play many games on their. You can play with friends and customize your character. But it's only a 4/5 rating because you always get kicked from the game your in. Like ONE time me and my friends were gonna play this game. And only me was not getting kicked from the game like ALL MY FRIENDS WERE TRYING AND ALL IT SAID WAS ""you were kicked from this game"". another thing is you have to buy robux like I'm poor becuz of that."
1922,1923,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Dominique Fougere,"Roblox is a fun game ypu can play with your friends and family. The games I like playing are adopt me, Royal high, and bloxburg. I also like trying new games for fun when I get sick of the other ones I like. The down fall ofroblox is that sometimes it takes awhile to load or its a little laggy. But other than that Roblox is a really amazing game and I think you should download it!"
1923,1924,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,5,Chamere Hodge,Good games and on mobile it lags with the lost ping and I can't get a mic any type of way even the regular way or YouTube way it just glitched out and everything sometimes and then it doesn't let me in to do what I have to do to get a mic I'm over age man that Is the bad things but off that subject it sill a great and good game and games it great 👍

But one thing I wished they didnt change about their app was the iconic ""OOF"" sound and instead they recently replaced it with a thing that sounds like ""Gah"" ok that's all I hope this review was helpful but I do recommend to download this byeeee guys<33"
1927,1928,2022-08-17,2022,08,17,5,Lyndsey Galloway,This game is so awsome its basically a hub with loads of games in it my favourites are brookhaven and Club roblox one problem though when l join some games like royale high it lags and takes me to the home page which kinda sucks when I want to play some games please fix that bug thanks have a great day/evening/night!!

Roblox please fix these bugs.
1929,1930,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Lisa Burdick,"Roblox is a really fun game! The only thing I have to say is they make it out like you can style your outfit for free, and then I clicked on the avatar button and I noticed it costed robux. That is really all but there are thousands of great games to explore and have some fun with your friends!❤"
1930,1931,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Ore Kolade,"I actually quite like this game. I have never played but its teaching my rabble (only parents will understand the struggle) a lot of things. Lizzies doing stuff with resturaunts, building a much more things. I will really advice trying this with your kids."
1931,1932,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,2,Owen Romain,It's an Amazing game. But there are little problems on this app. I hate the way you put the sensor For when you speak I hate it. Also Your Tazer Is not good at All it sucks. The Aim sucks very bad Please fix that. For the Security The Security Logo Is Very bad. Also You should not Put the request To handcuff someone if your security. That's badly done. Very poor. The team that made Roblox very poor. BUT I would recommend if you put At least a Walkie talkie For security. put more training 2 arms
1932,1933,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,5,Abigail,This is a really fun and poular game! I am in love with. The kids I babysit play this all the time and it gives them something to do with their free time. The first time I saw this game I thought it was going to be like fortnight or something but its actually just a server with a bunch of kid frindly games. I really recomened this game for kids or even adaults. I do normally find one game that is allways glichy and crazy but I never find games wih really bad quallity.
1933,1934,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,Aurelia Avila,"Its a good game really, BUT there's always the BUT... when ever i search for 'shirts' 't shirts' 'ETC' only the 3d models show up, maybe put a button that makes it 3d or just classic. And there are just way to much bugs."

And when i started to move my chacarter is not move at all. When i restart my tablet i go to roblox, go inside the game and always error. Ok thats all"

I think he should at least get a response, because hes been really down about it because he has a ton of friends and memories on that account. All I ask is for him to get a response to the situation."
1937,1938,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,alicia davalos,Roboxs has so many games to play you never run out of games too play it is so creative and it is so fun and I never want to stop playing it but it does have to fix some bugs in the game like hackers it needs to fix that immediately
1938,1939,2022-08-07,2022,08,07,5,ES Plays,Roblox is a very fun game I've been playing this game for around 5 or so years and it's super addicted and I really like it so much I don't really have any major problems other than sometimes the game lags. I bought the games currency Robux and it makes the game super fun with designing your avatar and just playing around with all the fun games all my friends are addicted we love playing together and this is also an opportunity to make more friends online while you play games. Roblox is amazing!
1939,1940,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,5,Lori Kreider,"Best game ever! Graphics for me (nice!) I love that there is tons of experiences that we can play! Just 1 thing, Please change the friend limit to 300. I have alot of people that I played with before that didint get to friend me. But if you fix that, it would be a way better game then now! 😀"
1940,1941,2022-07-25,2022,07,25,4,Martin Murphy,Roblox is a realy fun for me and lots of other people that play it but the only reason why I gave it four stars is that on Chromebooks it freezes a lot of the time and it annoys me too.Another bug I've seen is that when I change my avitar it dousn't change it.Please fix these bugs.
1941,1942,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,5,Rebecca Myers,"It's a really great games to play with friends, BUT, it can get really laggy in really any games, like just the screen randomly stopping, or just randomly moving, and it gets stuck, but you can make your own games on Roblox so I think it's pretty good overall. 5/5 Would recremend."
1942,1943,2022-08-04,2022,08,04,5,A Google user,"There are many different types of games from simulations, to tycoons, role-playing, and more each one with there own individual likenesses it's a great game and some stuff can be pretty educational. You can truly be anything you imagine."
1943,1944,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Era Glitch,This game is really fun and good to do when bored because of the almost unlimited different kinds of games and communities. How ever the tags system in the games in game chat is annoying at most times and I had tk turn censoring off. It also has several problems on mobile with the camera sticking that doesn't happen almost ever when I play on PC. Also when buying things from the in-game shop they can be deleted and leave you with a different item then what you bought.
1944,1945,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Butter milk.,"This is an good app, its has more games than you could imagine! Other players can type in chat, and there is voice chat for older players! This app is Okay for younger players. The down-side of this app is that there is inappropriate and bad games here, with toxic players and bad clothing. I would definitely recommend this app for more older players like 9yr players. Other than that, great app! And theres some glitches. Sometimes, if ur friend or someone elses avatar doesnt load, you cant c it."
1945,1946,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,4,Sundus Yacoob,It's great and I love it but sometimes it just closes the game you're playing and it's very annoying and it also disconnects a lot! It really glitches a lot. Sadly almost everything is for Robux and it's so unfair for the people who's mom and dad don't want to pay for a stupid game.I seriously love this game it's great! I like how they made Brookhaven with secret places and the funerals with funny notes on them and the game is just great! But please fix the bugs especially the robux one!
1946,1947,2022-08-16,2022,08,16,4,Mabel East,This game is amazing 👏 👍👏. It has so many games inside and you can make friends with people 😀 😉 😄. All though there's things you can or want to by like robux for out fits and games like bloxburg and passes THE PRICES! Like for £10 it's 800 I would like it to be £10 for 1000 or 999/950
1947,1948,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Barbara casaletta,"This is the best 😂 I've been playing for 4 years now and this is my favorite game! Also can you fix the lag and add cars that you can drive? Remove the lag two I only voted 4 stars because 1 . People are poor and can't afford robux like me 🙄, 2. HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED?!"
1948,1949,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Luke Smith,"Great variety of games and great gameplay. Rating it 4 stars and not 5 is because the chat filtration and moderation could use some work and there are the few occasional toxic players you meet throughout the experience. Overall though, very good! I enjoy Roblox a lot and it's a lot better playing with friends."
1949,1950,2022-08-10,2022,08,10,4,harry james,"I love this game but well you see there's a bug, so basically sometimes you go in a game and it puts your screen up instead off sideways witch can be annoying and it happend to me on bloxburg so I was really mad so pleas fix this and yea it's a great game 🙏🔧🎮"
1950,1951,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,John Kenneth Magno Potenciano,Hey roblox can you please optimize the game i use a 1GB ram phone and use my 2GB ram phone but still laggy and can you please add a setting that will lower the blocks quality please fix the lags and bugs and the camera when you're moving and pressed the roblox icon it will be stuck at one angle. And i have a question is it normal when the characters are really choppy when you're playing tho?
1951,1952,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,3,Deana Lovejoy-Warren,I have experienced a bunch of glitch. One time I get back to the home screan then when I turn it off I can't look around and move at the same time. It's pretty annoying for it to do that but I allsow experienced lags. Kicks. And disconnectones. I like to say that the game was so god but it just has error problomes.
1952,1953,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,4,ash dunlap,"i love this game so much! the tags are a little annoying but i do get the reason for them. i think vc should be enabled to everyone over the age of 13, just so we can experience new stuff. sometimes the games a little laggy but other than that its a great platform!!"
1953,1954,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Justine M.,Its good but could u please fix the camera bug in mobile cause everytime i play when i accidentally click the roblox logo while moving my camera bugged i cant rotate only zoom and out and sometimes its stuck in a view this problem is really worst and u have to leave the experience just to fix that problem and its frustrating for us that going to quit the game just to fix and play properly if this is fix ill edit my review overall the game is good its just the camera bug in mobile is the problem.
1954,1955,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,4,Shazia Clara Selsadeela,"I really like this app,you can really do anything.There are loads of games you can play with your friends.The reasons i like this game is becsuse you can create your own avatar and make friend.I realy love this game because when i can't see my friends face to face,I usually play Roblox with them.The reason im giving it only 4 stars is because a lot of things in this game cost robux which you need to buy with money,and i don't like that.so that's the only problem,other than that the game is good."
1955,1956,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,3,Erex Angelo Ginandoy,"It's a great game but there's a few problems,first the camera sometimes can't move it's very hard for mobile players,second it just move without even touching the screen.But rather then bugs overall it's good."
1956,1957,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,5,Lisa Scully,"I think this game is great! There can be bugs at times but honestly I have to say, the work that goes into it, is unbelievable I gave it a five star because it deserves it! I you do have to update it every once in a while but that just makes it better! Hope you enjoy the game:) 🌈😃"
1957,1958,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,3,John Dorow,"Roblox was a very smooth running game but latley i have been having glitches,if i move the screen wrong i get big broght colored panels all over the screen. Or the screen goes fully black,it will randomly kick me out of games it will tell me it disconnected and rejoining is not working or it failed. I tried to uninstal and reinstal to fix it but now it is not letting me reinstal at all. This is very annoying. Please fix these bugs,it will stay 3 stars until it is working properly again."
1958,1959,2022-07-28,2022,07,28,4,lily omar,It's a really nice game I really like it but I have a couple of bugs that are really annoying me 1 the screen glitch a lot of people complained about this 2 when I want to buy rubox it says this purchase is not complete it's really annoying I finished my robux and I want more
1959,1960,2022-07-26,2022,07,26,4,Cooper Nashton,"Great app! I really only use the app for customization, as i play on pc, but sometimes the editor just endlessly loads on a white screen! I've tried everything to fix it and it just randomly happens :( please fix this"
1960,1961,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,3,Kxlise Torres,It's a good game I've been playing since 2017 but it randomly crashes especially when I'm in avatar customization If I don't have auto rotate on sometimes it'll take up to 3 minutes to load in a game. If I play a game like royal high or other high quality games it immediately crashes even if my wifi connection is perfect and I have full bars
1961,1962,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Isabella Raines,"Love this app! It's not just an app though! It's a place where people can find other people that share the same interests with you! I play wild horse islands alot, I find people that like horses just like me! I do recommend the game though! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! 😁"
1962,1963,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Laura Ford Huber,Roblox is a very fun app to play with friends and meet new people but I have few problems 1. When I play roblox sometimes it will freeze and when I try to move it and I move a little it will zoom in and out 2. When I try to update it sometimes it says roblox can't update so I try later and same thing 3. It sometimes kicks you out and it lags a lot and sometimes you cant get back in but overall it's a good app
1963,1964,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,2,abhishri ranjan,This is an okay app but the worst thing about is that whenever I play in my tab it closes every 1 min automatically which VERY annoying. One of my favourite tycoon game does not save any progress so when it closes every 1 min it's really annoying. If you don't fix this in the next update THEN I will never install this app and won't recommend it to my friends either
1964,1965,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Junjun Cui,"The format and activity this game brought is amazing during earlier stages of development. You could put this game into numbers of varieties, competition, childhoods and gameplay. This game created creative and great generations throughout the many hardships and years for children and teenagers. But this also made the game a little less friendly and childish as it may seem.. This includes gambling and other subjects involving a ""childs game"" using the stock market.."
1965,1966,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,4,Alyan Ahmed,I like the game alot i have been playing this game for 3 something years and i would like to give 5 stars but please add these things 1 add some sort of thing which u could do quest for robux 2 add a control menu (which gives you a menu of controls to use)and 3 add a control setting (both pc and mobile)so we can set keys(pc) and set where to put controls (mobile) otherwise this is good game and a 4.5 rating
1966,1967,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Alyana Ortega,"IT'S SUCH A GOOD GAME, THERES LOTS OF GAMES TO PLAY, AND LOTS OF NEW FRIENDS THAT I CAN MAKE, I JUST LOVE THIS GAME SM!! 💗. But, Sometimes my screen keeps getting stucked, so can u somehow fix it?, I would really appreciate it. Also why do I keep disconnecting when my wifi is good?, pls fix that to."
1967,1968,2022-08-12,2022,08,12,5,Noelle Eads,"This game is a very good game. I have no problems with it and it works perfectly fine. When I play it I play for about 2 hours ect. It's fun, and it has a lot of games on the platform inside a game. Overall this is just a great app and I've been playing this game for 4 years tops. I recommend it!!"
1968,1969,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,5,Cee,"Roblox is and has always been a fun and safe place to be, to socialise with others, play fun games with your freinds and staying in contact with the outside world through a screen. I love it so much as a safe and fun way to entertain me. A huge variety to chose from. Even though it is super safe I would recommend keeping to the age regulations since there is a lot of acess to games that may not be appropiate for say a 6 year like shouting and killing. But it is fun and customisable"
1969,1970,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,4,Sarmila Dutta,I love this game but there are some annoying things alsowhich you need to fix: 1) Disconnecting without any reason 2)Too many glitches 3)The username can't be same so I need to think of a unique name for an hour!! Pls fix this..!! 4)In livetopia you can add more horror houses as we all love horror!!And please try to add cute and aesthetic bedrooms.. Thank you to the Creator! You are an Inspiration to everyone!!
1970,1971,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,4,Psiholog i to pametan,"This game is amazing you get to play with you're friends and even more. I love it so much, I play with my friends its so fun. thanks for fixing the bugs.You do not want to play Live Topia because then you need to uninstall it,it's so annoying."
1971,1972,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,3,A Google user,"I would rate roblox a five or four star, however, roblox has major lag issues. Alongside that considering it's not major or anything at all in some games, things that some people love are getting taken away or even removed entirely that people payed for with no refund. Latching off of that, things get changed often, and people don't like it anymore and still no way to return. Something I thing should be added or featured with a robux pass is, returning items to get robux back from our character."
1972,1973,2022-07-31,2022,07,31,4,Paige Barlow,"Its Amazing but idk if it is just mine, sometimes atleast for 20 minutes I have to wait for it to load and in the fashion games it freezes a lot. But the games are really amazing and I mean amazing PS: Annalise likes I mean LOVES to play roblox ☺☺☺"
1973,1974,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Abu Maria,"This game is really fun coz it's a game that has a million more games in it. You can play with friends and family anytime and everywhere with anyone. It also has no ads. My favourites games in this game are islands, tower of misery and adopt me. I really recommend it to you. It really helped me cope with the loneliness in quarantine."
1974,1975,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Manal Laghoui,This game is awesome but there's some type of glitch where when in the middle of me playing in a game I literally the GameStop I can't like I can't turn around my cat I can't turn my camera I can zoom in and zoom out so I can't really play the game and so you just get stuck in the corners all the time please fix the bug but still this is a great game
1975,1976,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,1,Robert Brooks,"Well first off for a mobile player,there are loads of problems including, crashing out of games, lagging, getting disconnected for no reason and so on. I play a game of meep city, I crash. I play a game of the rake,I crash and it's so annoying,all I'm trying to do is play the game and I crash. And even I looked up problems why am I crashing and yet still doesn't work, it's so confusing. PLEASE update this game for mobile users so they won't go through this."
1976,1977,2022-07-27,2022,07,27,2,Invidious,"We all know what this service is and what it's used for. Despite the games on this platform being extremely fun and well made, there are many dark things going on. Examples: there is basically a black market, but since this is through third party services roblox doesn't take responsibility. Also, albeit rare, there have been cases of grooming third-party. So it's a somewhat shady platform, that holds some fun games. Give it a shot but tread with caution (lowered rating bc they removed the oof)"
1977,1978,2022-08-14,2022,08,14,5,Bella Spink,"It's fun, it has different games you can play there's tycoons, parkor and lost of other fun stuff. Sometimes it can be very difficult, I get a little angry when I full on parkor. It's very frustratrating though especially when it comes to parkor but it can be very fun when it comes to tycoons so I suggeste that you play roblox make sure not to be a noob and get ROBUX our else you will get bullied because they will think your poor.SO GET ROBUX!!! You will get upgrades a lot. Get rid of the bug!!"
1978,1979,2022-08-02,2022,08,02,3,Sabrina Almonte,I love the app but sometimes it just becomes boring and there are glitches. There are a lot of games to play but I just wish there we're more free stuff that are cool for people who don't have robux. But in the end i like it there a lot different games and its fun.
1979,1980,2022-08-21,2022,08,21,2,GhoulBot,"So many glitches, your screen gets stuck and you sometimes you can't jump and you have to press the roblox button 2 times and instead of having only 3 items in your inventory bar i wish i could have 5, we already have longer phones, after each of these problems have been solved i'll add 1 star for each of them"
1980,1981,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,5,Andrea Leo,"This is a nice game to play with your friends, play games any type you like or want to try and you can edit your character! But 1 problem, you need robux for some things for your character to look good and on my other account I went from 400R to 1R,And in almost every single game you need robux to get better stuff in the game but no ads at all so I'm fine if you don't want to get the game. Thank you for your time❤"

1982,1983,2022-08-19,2022,08,19,4,Giovanni saquic,This is one of my favorite game. but there is just a problem. Whenever I play a game I accidentally press the Roblox Logo on the top left corner of my phone and My camera is glitch. Sometimes this happens to me. I hope they fix this issue.
1983,1984,2022-08-01,2022,08,01,4,Nikkie Price,There is a verity of games but on some divices the screen will go grey and it will take you back to the home of the game overall the game is good the clothes choices not so much but the actuall game is really good the quality of the game and gamr its self you make new friends and join to enjoy the game together
1984,1985,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Kaitlyn Wolf,"This is a very fun game. It has a variety of games. There is every game you could think of. Some are challenging, but I think you will love it. It is super safe. Any number or swear words get tagged. Now these people are real like player but you can interact. I recommend this game to anyone but mainly 6 and up. I am 11 and I am addicted!! This is my opinion. Give it a try🥰"

1986,1987,2022-07-30,2022,07,30,4,Dawn the Dove,Me and my friend have been playing almost every night! This game is wonderful. I broke my phone and she won't text me back. But her account was taken by a mean girl who goes to our school. She won't give it back. The account was my friend's and she changed the email and the password. I have no updates on the account. There's also people who are just disgusting! I was playing Brookhaven and a boy comes up to me and asks if I wanted to do the nasty. I immediately left the server.
1987,1988,2022-08-05,2022,08,05,5,Dewey Dahl,"The game is amazing! There are millions of games to play, and most are really fun! I just wish you could make it so that we can create games on devices other than Pc. Overall, great game! p.s, there is no ads so thats AMAZING!"

The only thing I didn't like is all the glitches but I really like the game BROOKAVEN RP🏡🏡🏡.I really don't like Hackers and the game Tower of Hell is Really offensive to me as a Cristin and Others so I would like that To be Removed.

1997,1998,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,4,Xiomara Ayabarreno,"Roblox has been a game I've wanted for a while and and I really like it, but it's a bit dissapointing. It lags a lot and there are only so many things you can do without robucks. If here were a way people could earn robux by playing a certain amount if games or joining a reward system that would be great. Other than that it's an awesome game."
1998,1999,2022-08-08,2022,08,08,4,Titus Linebaugh,"I have fun with all of my friends and make new ones on the way. You play and talk with people frome all arownd the world!

1999,2000,2022-07-29,2022,07,29,5,Brooklyn Mettemeyer,"I wouldn't say Roblox is a game itself, it's more of a platform for people/developers to create games for other people to play! It works very nicely though. I like how there's a yearly award ceremony that anybody can vote on! There's also many free items for people who can't buy Robux! Overall, it's an amazing platform to play and socialize on!"
2000,2001,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,4,andrew,"I loved this game ever since my friend told me in 2019 and made me my first account. It had a lot of bugs (example glitching into the ground, or due to the wi fi you can only see the sky) that we're annoying. Please fix that and also bring back the old profile in the home page! I'd like to see Roblox fix the safechat system"

This is starting to become anoying, beacuse sometimes my wifi works slow. That is not even all the problems with playing on a chromebook. Roblox does not let me get out of game when I try to get out of the game. It is really annoying please fix these problems!"
2002,2003,2022-08-11,2022,08,11,3,mao,"Roblox is overall decent game, but there is some things that I hate. I hate the fact they changed to 1 hairs only because my child has bought 2 hairs to wear them both, but couldn't which made her very upset. Secondly, there's barely any help when someones been hacked. So many people got hacked but couldn't be helped."
2003,2004,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,4,Kapil Malhotra,"This is a very fun game and is good to pass time fast. It has millions of different types of games like escapes , obbies , quizzes and much more . I just wanted to say that if you get frustrated fast then i don't recommend the game because you can get disconnected from the game anytime and you won't even know it . But you can also add friends and play with them and you can make your own avatar and that's why I rate this game 4 of 5 stars"
2004,2005,2022-06-26,2022,06,26,2,Metwally Ebrahem,"For real I was going to give it 5 stars but the problem is that when I was playing in the computer I works smoothly but when I tried it in the phone the amount of lag, bugs, disconnecting is to much that I thrown roblox but I came after some months to play it started to tell me network issues even when my wifi is working perfectly so if you could fix this two problems it will be greatful and it will help to many people ♡´･ᴗ･`♡"
2005,2006,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,4,Mie mie Soe,This is probably one of the best games I've played. It's not even a game! It's a platform where developers can create their own games. It's worth creating and playing. The only thing that is making me frustrated is the game isn't made with UE5 or UE4. It's still a good game. I give it four stars for great graphics but why the original roblox graphics is not great?
2006,2007,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,4,James Jacques,This game is amazing and ive been playing since i was 9. I really love the game and all the varity of things you can do but i have one complaint. I would like you guys to add the create item on the Chromebook because i would really like to create games and outfits on my Chromebook but it doesn't let me so i hope you guys will take the time to read this and add it to chromebook. :)
2007,2008,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Sofia Glitzer,"Amazing game! There are so many things to play, like, if you wanted to role play you could or if you wanted to do obsticle courses you could. So, over all its a amazing game. There is just one thing that kind of annoys me. Its the robux currency. I feel like you should be able to maybe watch adds to get like, ten robux. Thats all I have to say."
2008,2009,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,5,Alissa Scott,I love the game its my favourite game but I have a few issues with the game. 1) I keep disconnecting and I check my WiFi works fine and it's super annoying when it's a game what doesn't save your progress. 2) my camera sometimes doesn't turn and I have to rejoin the game to make it work again. Overall a fun game!
2009,2010,2022-07-12,2022,07,12,4,Kiley McAbee,OMG i love this game i been playing it for 3 years now and I love it!!!!! Theres many different games and new people to meet but there's a little problem my cousin tried to get on it and it keeps logging her out and glitching when she gets on a game and it keeps disconnecting her I don't know why but it's a great game! (Edited)<--------- Well another update it keeps disconnecting me from my games so I don't know why but sometimes it doesn't but then sometimes it does is it outdated? Or my WiFi
2010,2011,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,3,Tae_snowsky._,"I really like to play this game cz its like we can download one app and we can play many games we need..but the most annoying thing is camera bug and the laggy..my wifi is just in a good condition..but its still laggy.. about the screen bug.. I can't move my screen and its just can ""zoom in""& and the ""zoom out""..but sometimes its like I can't even control the screen.. there's nothing movee..pls fix this thing..i will appreciate that😔"
2011,2012,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,3,Ayden Willey,"Good game. But it has its flaws, first sometimes it glitches and disconnects me, next I play on mobile so I don't have access to certain games on computer or any other console which I feel like everyone should be able to play it because people either don't have those other consoles or can't afford them. So that's really all and if you don't agree with me just don't hate or argue."
2012,2013,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,3,Sei Ling Tan,"It's great, the games and all but it's starting to not let me load into certain games like adopt me, I would be the only one in the server and it would be just stuck there with either the sky screen or the blue screen (for adopt me) I don't rlly know if its my device or the game but if it's the game I really need you to try fix it because it's a big problem not only adopt me can I not load in but also several others. I hope you try to fix it and make the game a better experience for us 😁"
2013,2014,2022-06-17,2022,06,17,4,Rita Margarette Mallari,It's cool it's nice bc there is alot of games their are scary ones funny ones simulator ones and so much more if you're a gun person you can play this game and if you like to dress up and cosplay brokehaven can do the trick there are a lot of different games there are building games ect. You can create games and dress up you're avatar and so much more their are some bugs tho sometimes when I go inside a game the camera zooms in and out when I don't want to and sometimes doesn't move at.
2014,2015,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,4,Brandon Lewis,4 stars good game i loveeeee it but it could use some changes lile for brookehaven it could use some house and car updates y'know but the game is great and for adopt me it lags when you first start the game and if you need to sign or login it sometimes kicks you out of the game. And sometimes ppl are not on the server and when i look at how many ppl are on diff servers and I'm on a server by myself so please fix that but GREAT GAME!! (please fix those bug tho-)
2015,2016,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,3,Rain Quintos,"It has a lot of you can friend but, sometimes they are a bit laggy or having bugs, Would you mind fixing it?, Look I'm not hating... But it's kind of annoying but this game is!,look you can play with friends and we can play many many games, you can costumize your avatar too! Overall I give it a 3/5 it's solid!"
2016,2017,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,3,Deanne Wells-Hunt,"I'm having issues with the app like why is the clothing blurring out, for example when I'm in game and I zoom in then out all my clothing is blurry. Another issue is something I have with the extension, BTRoblox. It was working just fine and I loved how we could put on multiple items on the avatar section, but just up to today, I was having issues with putting on more then just one item, so I was wondering if that is a minor issue that will be resolved in what I hope, the near future."
2017,2018,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,gem squad,"I really like this game but there are things like hackers because I have been hacked up to three times atmost and I hadn't gotten my stuff back. I spent hard earned money on this game for it all to got to waste, No. so I'd really like there to be an option to get stuff back also I have never shared my password email or anything. But other than that this is a great game and there are a few bugs that need fixed but again super great game I play it almost every day!"
2018,2019,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,4,Loserrr No,"Love this game. But I have an issue with the new 3d clothes. Whenever you search for clothes in the catalog it's so hard to find normal not 3d clothing, I'd like it if maybe you add more categories that are more specific. Or a clothes category so it'll be easier to look for normal clothes."
2019,2020,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,4,SCP THINGS ONLY 909,"This game is Amazing! You can play with friends , and other people! It's a great game. I spend my day playing it! But I have a small issue, When I move my camera. Mostly in the game called ""Spray paint (Trains!)"" It just glitches and repeats and then I have to go out."
2020,2021,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,4,Shiggy Nuggies,"This game is really good, but one problem for me is that it keeps sending me to the home screen every time I play with my friend or alone. It will also sometimes not let me join the game back!! Every time it kicks me out I try to rejoin. I get in the game the I play for like 3 MINUTES and then it takes me back to the home screen!!! Please fix this!"
2021,2022,2022-07-11,2022,07,11,4,Bekki DuBord,I think it's amazing I would give it a four and a half of I could but why it loses one star for me is because it loads so much when I have full internet and Wi-Fi. It just loads and loads and loads and it won't let me in. Then when it does updates it keeps telling me to update it so if you could see if you could fix that it would be amazing.
2022,2023,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,3,Cool Gamer65,"The game is great itself but, There are of course some unfixed bugs that have existed for an while: First is the classic camera can't rotate and it can only zoom in an out , Mainly caused when you lag, And also this causes another bug where you can't move the joystick thing , If these bugs were patched I would rate 5 stars , However they aren't so 3 stars"
2023,2024,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,4,Roula M,"This game is amazing!! You can play games,chat with friends,make friends, and create your OWN game. It is really fun, but it has many glitches. When I'm playing murder mystery, I press shift and (SOMETIMES) it doesn't work. And other times when im playing any game, it just stops letting me move or type. The only way to be able to type again is changing the tab. And for moving, I usually have to leave and rejoin. Though, this rarely happens. Roblox also has stupid rules and unreasonable bans"
2024,2025,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,5,Saira Aleem,"I love this app not only because it's so amazing and fun it has sooo many games that are fun BUT anything is not to good to be true !! The main problem is....BUGS!Ugh like whenever I play on the mobile sometimes the screen would glitch,freeze and disconnect even though my internet is fine!!😡 Then mostly the screen problem is zoom in &zoom out it keeps on doing that untill...I HAVE TO RECONNECT!! There are wayyy more problems than this but I'm too tired to write!! Overall good game pls improve"
2025,2026,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,5,Liam Baker,"Love it! If you download it the first game you play should be Raise a Floppa 2. Its online, so you can make your friends play and you can add to your friends list so you can tap on them if they're playing a game and join the same server they are in! I suggest playing. Update: I forgot to mention sometimes it won't load so I have to close it out and reopen but its fine I don't mind because I'm never in a hurry."
2026,2027,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,5,-Ethelbert Peralta Batoon,"the (only) issue im facing with Roblox is that it only uses only 1 gigabyte of RAM, giving me around 15-20 fps; i have a phone with 8 gigabytes of RAM and a Snapdragon processor but it only uses one. just one. can you help me on how to allocate more memory into roblox? i mean the game is fine but this problem is completely messing up my experience with the app. Update; the problem was fixed and its smoother now, cheers to the devs. ❤️"
2027,2028,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,1,Furious Boom,"The game optimization is bad. Sometimes, the camera view freezes and i have to leave the game then come back to get it working back. Please fix it. Otherwise, the game is good. Update: The audio update and the fact that this stupid moderation can ban people without context but cannot change a false birth date even when there's literally a topic for this on support ( i put 2002 then it changed to 2013 for no reason) made me attribute 1 star."
2028,2029,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,Kassi Diems,This game is really fun even when it as a hard time loading. It has no ads which is great because like 99.9% games have ads. There are multiple games to choose from. Sometimes it is hard to play the games though when is laggy or lagging but it's still a fun game. I highly love recommend downloading.
2029,2030,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,3,Kenneth Cowley,"Its an awesome game but takes a very long time to update, I get kicked alot, and the reports don't even work! It can also be very upsetting when the screen freezes making you have to join a whole new server. Also some game won't let you rotate you screen (Mobil) Please fix it!"
2030,2031,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,4,Azaan Langari,This game is really a imagination center cause I have been playing for 2 years now and the game has amazing updates every once in a while. The only glitches are that when I was just playing a runner mini game in a ugc event and since we had to swipe ro move and sometimes my screen would freeze and start moving left to right. That's pretty much all I can say but I'll review about roblox soon
2031,2032,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,3,Paddle boat,I give it Three stars becuase when it is updating it takes ten years and its glitchy but all through pretty good although they shoulf fix the glitches. If you are able to make a offline option that would be appreciated just a offline option to play with alone obviously but keep the online one as well.! For some reason it won't update :( I am needing to uninstall roblox:( not ideal
2032,2033,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,5,GAMER FOR LIFE,Such an amazing game!!!only two problems rlly: is that sometimes my camera gets stuck and the only way to fix it is to leave and rejoin the game and sometimes my jump button gets stuck and then i just jump the whole time. So yea hope that gets fixed. RLLY AWESOME AND AMAZING GAME!!!! only one suggestion: put a leave and rejoin button in the menu when ur inside a game other than that... 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999+1 / 100 rating:)
2033,2034,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Emma Humble,"I rate it a 4 because it sometimes has bugs. Like I'm trying to reinstall it bc it keeps taking me out when I try to play but it's still taking me out. But other than the bugs and stuff, it's amazing! U can make online friends and add real life friends too!"
2034,2035,2022-06-17,2022,06,17,4,Jake Bam,"Fun. But sometimes it kicks me out of games. Also, the lag is pretty bad, plus, there is a glitch when I play Survive The Killer, which when I jump, I'm in the ground and go sliding around, one time, I was the killer, I had to reset because I was stuck behind a chair, please fix it!!!!"
2035,2036,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,3,Tonya Roberson,"It's nice in all but sometimes when I play adopt me it kicks me out after a certain amount of time and that's probably all I know,also when there's updates for the game it tells you to uninstall somes games and sometimes ask u to do it again and that's not good on my opinion,then when it can't update the game it says""can't install Roblox not enough space if this doesn't help go to feedback for common ways to fix the problem"""
2036,2037,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,3,Navi Anri,"just like campbells review when i go into first person and i click, the mouse will shift off away from the middle. This is bad because i go into first person for more acurite clicks. It is also staaring to get annoying because if i try to click something, it will not click so i have to shift my camera postion and it is really troublesome and uneccasary"
2037,2038,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,3,Rajiv Singh,"It's a great app , but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because , Sometimes, my screen lag/glitch alot while playing games , or isn't able to move.. and that mostly happens when I click my menu and turn it off.. and i think roblox should modified scammers in avatar , or doesn't allow to use them such same image as the original one.. that's all , over-all it's a good app , i recommend you to atleast give a try"
2038,2039,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,5,XxLil_LizzyxX 910,"Great game! Love it :) super entertaining but one slight problem, the other day i wanted to log in on my phone, but i forgot my password and cant view it anywhere, i tried changing it but i had to comfirm the old one so i cant do that either, i hope you can add a feature to view your password, thats all. Thank you! Edit: I changed my pass and it works now , i have a screenshot so ty !! (Btw this was an old feature)"
2039,2040,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,4,Jerald Mitchell,"I enjoy the game, but there's some issues. One of them is the fact that I can't play on my Iphone all the time, so I play on my Acer Chromebook 315. It's recently begun to close out, and freeze where I can't reopen the app, and there dosen't seem to be a solution. Also, the censors aren't really good at their jobs because they censor too much. Plus, I think it'd be great if there was a update where you can watch adds for robux, like once or three times a month would be nice."
2040,2041,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,4,Everyone,"It's a good app, but sometimes the concept of ""Robux"" can get annoying, aswell as the toxicity and slenders, cnps, and the rules. Rthro made everything suck and now you're encouraging it. I don't like the idea. Sometimes (I don't know if it got fixed because I don't play on mobile anymore) But when you're on mobile, sometimes the sentence gets cut off, like, only half of what you said would show, and the tags are SO annoying, please only filter what is actually necessary. Other than that it's ok"
2041,2042,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,5,FrodoFunnehlover peedroidpoo,"This game is great for kids 15 Years old or less, Ecspecially when the updates come, though sometimes it randomly takes me off of the the game. I always check to see if something is up with my wifi when it does that, but nothing is wrong with my wifi. Other than that, Roblox is a great game!!! I recommend it!"
2042,2043,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,5,Alda Stannis Kasun,"It's a great App ^^ rlly fun and so many games, the only problem is lag and a very big problem which is, whenever I move my screen sometimes it would stop and it would get stuck, like I can only zoom in and out, there's another one that moves the screen by the joystick, please fix that many people are asking that but tho the game is great"
2043,2044,2022-06-26,2022,06,26,5,DEVIL LILA,"Yes it's a great game. Some flaws but overall it's amazing. Fun, entertaining and you can make friends! Do be safe on Roblox as people lie about who they are. I would recommend saving your acc password on a piece of paper or on your device. Adding a backup email would help to. Be sure not to share any info as this app is easy to hack accounts with few amount of information. I have lost an account were I worked really hard on. I almost lost my new account with over 40k Robux been spent- Bye 😀"
2044,2045,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,Abla Mahamdeh,I give it a 4 because it's a great game but there are some lags and issues that need to be fixed like when I try to join a game sometimes it just says disconnected even though my internet is fine and there are lags when you join certain games it will stop going like in and out of the screen and you can't move and it's portrait mode instead of horizontal and you can't change it even if you have auto rotate on it is a good game but I rated a four because it's just there's lags and issues
2045,2046,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,4,ʚ moochi ɞ,"In all honesty, this game is great. A wide variety of games to play, find yourself with the bestest friends you could ever meet and just an amazing experience to glide through. But, there is a downside to all good games. If you have played the game, your probably gonna know these issues, such as fluffy icons/clothing, when you type, Roblox cuts it off, ect. If this somehow gets fixed, I would play the game more often."
2046,2047,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,5,danish b,The problem is when I play any games like blox fruit it's like everyone is hacking and there's a lot of hackers in this game and the another problem is 1. that when I play the camera is not moveable and it keep zooming up and out. And when I play it automatically jump non-stop till my friend or my brother help me. Pls fix this. This is the best game I've ever played. It would be better if u could fix this game. :)
2047,2048,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,3,Courteney Harman,"It's really fun! I love the variety and character choices. The only bad comment I have is that my device won't run most of the games I wanna play. So I can't really enjoy the full experience. It's disappointing, but I have a few fun games I can play. Overall it's really good, just some unenjoyable laggy games I wish I could play-"
2048,2049,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,5,venkataramanaiah kanchi,It's very fun to play the games!but since I'm in a phone there are alot of glitches too! I don't know if it only happens in phones but...pls make sure to take care of it it's really annoying other than that!! I think the game is PERFECT!don't know the right word but it's really great good work!😘😘😍

It is amazing! I would definitely recommend this app!😁😁😁😁Update:Ok the reason it disconnected all the time was because I was playing in a dead spot."
2050,2051,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Jessica Graciani,"I love the app so much i've been playing it for a long time now, and if you're new to the app there are hundreds of games in he app. and if you really wanted to, you can make your own game. but sometimes gliches and lags happen on only some games. for exampel on'brookheaven' i want to change into some driffrent clothes but it makes my body look weird like it makes my head smaller and my body bigger,but then when leave the game it looks perfectly fine i look amazing. thats all i wanted to roblox"
2051,2052,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,5,Ayden Alger,"great game in general even though i rate it 5 stars i would like you to add an option where you can refund your purchase even if you only get half robux back. Also it would be helpful if you could go to the friends in setting and have a tab that says recent servers and it would display the games in what youve last played and you could click on the game and look at the servers youve been in that game, this would be helpful because you could of been disconnected from a server and didnt have time"
2052,2053,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,3,Alexis Miyelle,"Yes, this game is awesome, entertaining, etc. But there's a reason why I put four stars. Whenever I play a game a few minutes in, I disconnect, My internet is stable, whenever I'm playing something, I make friends ofc, but I disconnect and forget to add the people, I will lose the server and the friends I made, please do something. (PROBLEM 2) Ever since I made this review, Roblox keeps logging me out while PLAYING, I may quit but this is the only this keeping me entertained, please fix this.."
2053,2054,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,5,Eralyn Holtzapple,"Since there is no ads it's easy to have fun and long gameplay. The only thing that is super small is when I try to log onto Broken Bones IV it always kicks me out or tells me to ""Try again later"". It gets super annoying but overall, great app!"
2054,2055,2022-06-26,2022,06,26,4,Hannah Bryant,i had to install the game in my compter lesson at school and then ive played it so much since. i have given it 4 stars just because sometimes it wouldnt load up my game or if it just wouldnt open. ive had to unistall and the re-install the app for some of the games to load and not kick me off the site. overall i would recomend the game.(edited)i have still been having the problems with me getting kicked of pls fix this then i might change the reveiw. thanks
2055,2056,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,5,Daria Morgan,"It's a very nice game, though sometimes like in adopt me when I join or reset there is no floor. So I have to leave and rejoin. Also, on mobile such as tablets and phones in royal high it's very laggy. I still play royal high on my computer (which is not laggy,) and I love it.just in some games it's really laggy. So please try to fix the lags. There are also some inappropriate games but otherwise it's a very nice game."
2056,2057,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,5,Mike Morbitzer,"Great game. I was checking reviews and saw that people's screens were becoming unable to move on mobile, the solution is simple, go to the screen where you can leave/reset,after that just resume playing and problem should be solved!"
2057,2058,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Addelynn Crass,I love this game! I can hang out with friends and make friends too♡ this game is good for Socializing but it can be inappropriate sometimes to. It can also be annoying by reconnecting and laggynes!!! But over all this game is super super fun and can inortate many people from all ages !!!!!!!!:)
2058,2059,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,3,Helix,"Not good. Fix some bugs devs. My account has been bombarded with the error: 268 for 3 years now. My account hasn't been banned. I've tried fixing this by many methods from deleting and reinstalling, to changing to the windows version. Both on pc and on mobile this bug still occurs frequently."
2059,2060,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Serena Fisher,"Ok I have a couple problems here but you still deserve 5 stars! Ok so here are my problems for mobile, every time I play adopt me or whatever game I will instantly glitch, and lag. 2. Almost every single time I play it I could have amazing internet and I still disconnect with only like 0-1 apps open!? And it's been freezing but like freezing that I can't even exit out of the game! Please fix these it is bothering me you are one of my favorite games. Please understand."
2060,2061,2022-06-19,2022,06,19,4,HD - Gaming,"It's a great game. The only issue I have is the verification system and the chat filter. The verification system is trash and the chat filter doesn't always work properly. People always find a way to bypass the system to be able to say their age, phone number, or even worse, swearing. All in all, it's a good game, just be aware that this is an issue that is in the game. Oh and another issue I'd like to note, when you purchase something it takes a while to process, so be aware of buying Premium."
2061,2062,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,4,Abby Hogan,I Love it me and my sister play all the time but we both feel thier should be some way to get the in-game currency with having to spend accrual mouny for it and do like challenges ro complete every day that give you 10 of the in game currency for each challenge along with bonus challenges per month. Also with the challenge they shouldn't expire after a while.the challenges should be per day too. You can still purchase your in-game currency for mouny. Please consider this for roblox. Thanks 😃
2062,2063,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,2,melodie Bradley,My nieces favorite game. Mainly a bunch of obstacles courses. Sometimes the controls are difficult for me but my niece has no issues with it. It's colorful and interesting to watch. Im so angry. It deleted my house on build to survive. I didn't do anything. I signed off before supper and tried to get on later and my 4 story house was gone. Im so angry and devastated
2063,2064,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,4,Hà My Hoàng Ngô,"The game was great but some of the games like adopt me is bad. Cause when ever I want to buy some thing cause alot of robux then it has an kind of board and it was always staying there and I can't reach the ""x"" part to delete it cause it also had another row of words like ping, sent, CPU, GPU and Revc. And when ever I try cliking the ""x"" the ping always open up amd I couldn't delete the sign away! So I had to leave the game and get in it again.( the sign's very anoying!)"
2064,2065,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,3,Bill Parker,"(on someone else's device so yeah) I love Roblox and it's really addicting and fun, but the problem is the glitches. Recently today, I tried to play a game and my character and other characters started appearing and disappearing. I tried lots of things like redownloading the game, but that didn't work. Hopefully Roblox can fix this."
2065,2066,2022-06-10,2022,06,10,4,Jace Hickman,"This game is one of my favorites, the only thing I have to say is that, the graphics quality for my computer, can't be put higher than 4, even if I'm just trying to see further, then my quality goes up, and crashes my game, I think it would be a good idea to have something like Minecraft, where you can change the quality, and the view distance."
2066,2067,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Diana Castro,"Not going to lie it's a great game because it has many games in one but it sometimes says ""Check Network connection"" when my network it perfectly fine. Also it disconnects your game for no reason. But other than that it's a very awesome and fun game."
2067,2068,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,2,mona nafees,"It's a very good game but the reason I gave 2 stars because, when open the game it says ""please check your internet connection"" but my wifi is always working fine! And second I have to restart my phone to play it. Its becoming so annoying and I always get disconnected in every single game!! It's getting out of control it's making wanna rage sometimes I literally hit my phone with my hand but gladly it's strong cause I've been using it for almost 4 years. Now back to the point, just please fix it"
2068,2069,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Ty Larsen,"It's a good game and all, but sometimes when I am playing a game my screen does something where it won't let me zoom in and out. If I want to Zook in and out I have to use 1 finger instead of 2. This makes it impossible to move your screen around unless you rejoin. Please fix this"
2069,2070,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,4,Hanan Hassen,"This is a very good game but I would like if there was a way to get robux without paying, for example, tasks/missions, ex. Play 3 survival games, or Get 5 badges in 1 hour, and these tasks/missions would give the player 3-5 robux, so the player could save up for more expensive things in game without paying for them."
2070,2071,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,3,Chad Rogers,It has a lot of glitches but there is also bad and inappropriate content people use and do with the features. Like for example someone used the rollover act and did inappropriate things with it in Wolf Life 3.I also don't like how you can only make a game if you are on a certain computer. So I have to go all of the way to my aunts house to make a roblox game. But overall the games are good but Im giving it 3 stars because of those reasons but the rest of it is fine just those little things. Thx
2071,2072,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,4,Stephanie Klipfel,"Its really entertaning! i have some problems though. One, my biggest problem, is that i got hacked (or logged out of my old account) 2 times now. It's really disappointing because i really like roblox. Two, every time i playd a rp game, the land would be blue, and i dont know how that happened. and therd, a few games are very laggy. at a point i wasn't even aloud into the game or hear the music. please fix these problems! ( my review will stay like this until these problems are fixed.)"
2072,2073,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,2,blktierra,The game functions like the mobile roblox but when it comes to playing the (HP chromebook ver) it's barely functionable. You can't even scroll and view other games with the mousepad they give you and the rotation on first player games doesn't even work properly. It only lets you rotate about 180 (not even a full 360 apparently). And if you close the app for at least 5s it instantly closes the experience/ game you're in. honestly the roblox on mobile is better than the google play ver on the HP.
2073,2074,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,3,Julie Pellegrin,"Well,this game is definitely not the best at all. There are many pros but in my opinion there is more cons than anything. I enjoy playing the game but it gets frustrating and annoying 😒. I hope they fix alot of the problems or I will delete the game and never play it again. Like how everyday u have to update and it's so glitchy."
2074,2075,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Hailey Ferricher,"This game has millions of apps! And if you get enough robux, you can make your own game that everyone can enjoy! But there is a few flaws that need to be fixed like when thereś an update, it stays pending for so long, and when itś done, it restarts again. But other than that itś a really good game."
2075,2076,2022-07-04,2022,07,04,3,amir washington,"The game is good, but I wish chromebook players weren't stuck on mobile. I'll change my rating once the game recognizes players as pc players. Edit:It's not just that, it bugs out even more on chromebook, and I have no idea how to fix it."
2076,2077,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,4,Daryll Cabrera,"I will rate 4 star now because 1 is harsh. There is something that really bothers me, it is so laggy in phone i have to switch to the lowest graphics and it still super laggy the longer i play the lagger it gets, it even has a lots of pauses every second and it has long pauses too like 10 seconds or 15 and the screen is so shaky, really shaky. Im on andriod, please fix these issues."
2077,2078,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,4,Brayden McElmury,"Good game, but whenever I go into a game, the game freezes on the loading screen and kicks me out saying, ""Roblox isnt responding"". I think its on their end though because I installed it on a different device hoping it would fix the problem, but it didnt. Otherwise its a good game."
2078,2079,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,4,iram fatima,"Overall this is a great game! BUT there is a screen glitch for mobile players where if you want to look around it only zooms in and out,especially in bedwars. Please fix this glitch, it annoys me A LOT! It would help me very much! Thank you 😊"
2079,2080,2022-07-11,2022,07,11,2,Kashy Peterson,"I will give it a 2 because it was fun while it lasted, Because these days when I join any game the screen turns black it doesn't even work. It also sometimes kicks me out. Like is it me or is it the device or something cause It never works🤦🤦 I got a new problem that it literally kicks me out the app not the game even tho the screen didn't turn black"
2080,2081,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,3,Rat Rat,good on mobile and pc but not a chromebook you cant get the game in the web browsers at all and if you want to change your settings you need to use the tuoch screen wich is really anoying at times not to mention the fact that if you holld right click and turn to far and try to look up you might close the game and when you zoom in the same thing happends.
2081,2082,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,2,Jayden Robinson,"I geniunely love roblox but it has alot of bugs in the mobile app like your screen gets stuck and u cant move it, the dynamic thumbstick glitches and controls your screen, and you get stuck in shiftlock and cant get out enless you reinstall the game. I've been having the shiftlock problem and I have to reinstall the game everytime. It's so annoying and roblox clearly doesnt know how to fix its bugs bc this started in may. It's so annoying and I just wanna uninstall roblox and not reinstall it."
2082,2083,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,5,LaZy_Cøøkíe Anime,"Mkay basically i'm on pc now. I switched to pc because i have two flaws in my gaming. One flaw is that whenever i join a game (On mobile) my screen locks and makes me go back to the home screen (Or the loading screen) and i'll have to restart the app or wait a couple of minutes for it to work again. The second flaw is, it keeps logging me out! for no intire reason at all, and when i try to log into my account it says ""This user doesn't exist.""! But i have to admit that its pretty fun-"
2083,2084,2022-07-04,2022,07,04,4,DaSonicMan beta The meme gamer,"This game is great in all,but when I try to increase my graphics,it always lags and moves slow, also no matter what I do,I can't get the voice chat feature for some servers. So in my opinion, they really need to fix this."
2084,2085,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,5,cool Richie,This game is the best game ever you can customize your boy parts and you can play games with your friends and more!! But just one problem sometimes my screen glitches like for example of you control the control button it will move as well just switch to the classic but the zoom in and out I don't know how to do it I just really hate it when I games glitches when I play I wish Roblox could fix this.but still 5 stars
2085,2086,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,5,Fatouma Legend,"Amazing app!! Very entertaining and most of my day passes by quickly when I am bored! The only thing I wish there was, is more free faces and outfits since a lot of people just can't get robux for their own reasons and I think that they should have more options. Overall this is an amazing app since there are many games to choose from and you never get bored so I recommend giving it a try!"
2086,2087,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,3,Lisa,I do love it but one thing that really annoys me is that on mobile while in a game if you keep your joystick in the same place then it auto walks and to make it stop I press the area to leave game then press resume but then it locks my screen in place so I can't zoom in or out also some times it would get to sensitive that if I even try move my screen it zooms me in and out so yeah but it is a really good app either way.
2087,2088,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,Courtney Burgess,"All these games to choose from you can make an avatar just amazing I really like this game it is so fun. It has adopt me,piggy,it lurks, murder mystery, color block,and there's way more it's just great. This game is so much fun obviously it's really cool. you can Even play together. You can make friends and the limit is so high. I love it it's just plain amazing. Why I gave it a four star is that it boots you out,but I think that's because I have no internet. I definitely recommend playing it."
2088,2089,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Abi_playsgames game's,Roblox is the best because you can play with friends and text your friends too. I love it so anyone who loves online games or meeting new people this is the game for you! But there is a couple of problems the first one is I keep getting kicked out of games and its soo super laggy and I get soooo mad when it happens but I'm not blaming it on the creator I just would like it fixed please . Thank you for reading until the end.
2089,2090,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,3,Anonymous Fred,It's a really good game and all but ever since 2 days ago my homepage has been starting to take so long to load and sometimes the connection error will pop up on my screen although my connection was okay. I am not sure if it's due to my device or a bug that happens to some people sometimes but it's starting to get really annoying
2090,2091,2022-07-15,2022,07,15,5,Lexi Bertero,"This is one of the best games i have ever played, i love it so much! It has multiple different games in it, like, who would have thought of something so cool? The updates are frequently added so the bugs are fixed! Did I already say i love this game? I would love to see all the bugs fixed one day, looking forward to it! I think this game is great for ages 5+ for all the varietys of game choices! 100% recommended!!! ♡"
2091,2092,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Taelynn Arbaugh,I love this game no contest but the issues like I get disconnected when I'm fine at internet? And my screen gets stuck at 1 angle. And whenever I'm jumping and like the jump button is froze and keeps making me jump. I know there's loads of games and it's super fun the issues I just don't like the issues. I love how you have many clothes pants etc. To choose from. I like how there's cute games and etc but I DON'T like trollers . And the reports barely work. I rate this a 4/5 bc the bugs.
2092,2093,2022-06-19,2022,06,19,4,Elexia Caley,"i love the app so many games but there is a few problems i have been noticing lately, i have been playing games and all of a sudden it kicks me off the app like i dont have time to play, im getting really anoyed of it, and another thing is that when i join a game it goes in shiftlock somehow?? there has also been bad glitches to. But i still really like the game."
2093,2094,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,4,valentine blackwell,"Nothing loads besides the main pages like the opening page, customization, etc. Notifications doesn't, neither do people's profiles, settings, or the servers page. I cant join a private server or clean out my friends list. I've tried logging out and logging back in and uninstalling and reinstalling the app"
2094,2095,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,oyster Puppy,"I love the game, but the only irritating flaw is that I have to constantly keep updating the app on my phone but I have other things to install too. So if I have to keep updating the app then it'll take up so much storage space and I don't want to keep uninstalling other apps so I can get something I want. If you where to change up the game just please make it to where u don't have to repeatedly update tge app. But other than that, this is my favorite game on my phone thanks for making it! 😁"
2095,2096,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,3,Dawn Gross,"In Bloxburg, the normal cheapy kinds of clothing racks dont work for me and keep me on the spinning circle with the word ""loading"". A lot of my games are really laggy and do not give the full expeirence I had hoped for. In royal high, every twenty minutes it kicks me out of the game for no good reason and I have to rejoin each time."
2096,2097,2022-06-12,2022,06,12,5,louriecel rina kutch,"OK so I love this game bot I have a few problems to say. First if I play something that has too much design I'm laggy. Secondly if I screen shot my screen and when I look around it only zoom in and zoom out. So yeah that all for today and I realy enjoy the game, and of pls fix the bugs!."
2097,2098,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,4,Laycee Cheney,Great game! I have been playing it for years and it has been awesome! The only issues is my account has been hacked. It kills your phone battery so fast. I will have 100% and then 20 mins later I'll have 40%! It really makes the game kinda bad. Also the tags! I understand they help hide stuff. But have gotten out of hand! I can't even type a number without getting it tagged! It might tag out numbers for ages maybe.? But nothing else really. I always play it with my friends! 4 stars!!!
2098,2099,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,5,Katherine Monreal,"I like the app so much because it has so many games so I rate it a 5, the downside is that there's some bugs in the games and I randomly disconnect for some reason, and I think the other players on this app experience it too. But what I like about this is that there are scheduled updates, meaning it can fix the bugs and also make new updates on the app."
2099,2100,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,4,James Allen Bogle,"It offers many frames, yet hackers are destroying the games like example fishing simulator where a hack is used to appear right away over chest and shipwrecks giving no chance to players. Many games suffer glitches as well adopt me white screen, in tunnel, in own door entry and at times any door entry. Along with being set in a void zone and one has to leave game as it won't reset."
2100,2101,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,5,Crash Flamm,The updates sometimes take a little bit to load but there are some awesome games that really makes me say wow. I love this game because of all of the different people and games. I would recommend SPLASH if I where you. it's a game where you can express your personality to another levle for other people's entertainment.
2101,2102,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,5,Camryn Tablet,"I absolutely love this game! There are so many different games you can choose. Obbys, simulators, role play, tycoons and tons more. Though a lot of stuff for your avatar costs robux, which cost money. Your avatar can become pretty cool if you put some thought into it. Even if your on moblie-if you have a fast tablet/phone- you can still enjoy it!"
2102,2103,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,5,Norhayna benito,"I really like it, there so many games that you can play you can play Tycoons,scary,and more so I'm giving this a Five stars But please fix the bugs sometimes when I want to look around it's just zooming in and out pls fix it that's the only problem:EDIT here it is again a problem i update it but it still not working whenever im tapping the app its getting back in home i have a data and wifi so whats the prob??"
2103,2104,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,4,Del Wilson,"This game is a very good game but, you have to upgrade it to play and if you don't upgrade it you can't play. It's very annoying though, but other than that it's a pretty decent game, you can make friends, chat and change you're avatar, it is entirely ad free! It may take up a lot of space but, it is certainly worth it. I personally think Roblox should lower the price of robux because, Roblox has been making the price go a little to high that some kids can't get robux. Thank you so much! (つ≧▽≦)つ"
2104,2105,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,4,Aturinda Sammie,"It is a nice game and very fun most especially brookhaven rp ,but the game has a lot of bugs like at a point the movements arent smooth and when you try to move it freezes and after some seconds its back to normal but it will move without you controlling and many people complain about the same thing but who ever wants to download it please do so because you will love it"
2105,2106,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,2,Lil Missy,"This is good to play! It's pretty fun, lots of different games you can play. Though I give it a 2 star rating because I like recording edits. But for some reason It won't let me record, it just makes my recording unable to record for some reason. And honestly that sucks. I tried many devices I had with rboblix and it didn't work. Hopefully this gets fixed."
2106,2107,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Shermarie Lucien,"Roblox is fun and engaging game, I find myself playing for hours. However, there are a couple of issues. There are times where my screen only zoom in and out, and stays in one direction. This only occurs on my phone, on my computer though I don't have this problem. So that's good news. But recently I repeatedly get kicked out of games because ""my wifi is giving trouble"", but my wifi is perfectly fine and stable. Hopefully, whatever is going on, gets fixed. Overall, it's a great game 👍"

The only problem is that, I play on a laptop, when I play obbies sometimes when I try to click something, the mouse moves from it'ss original spot which annoys me. But other than that it's an amazing game!"

And now whenever i play it says ""Roblox isn't responding"" and i have to press close because if i dont it gets frozen and i hope you can fix that."

ITS SO MUCH FUN AND JUST AWESOME, but i just have some problems with it, some games lag a lot and sometimes in brookhaven, it lags way too much, and in floppa (pop it trading) theres a something called billionaire reaper, please remove it, it takes everything from us which is also called reaping, other than that, THIS GAME IS AWESOME"
2110,2111,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,3,Joshua Garcia,"its fun but i HATE how when it says something about terms and agreements and i have to read ALL OF THAT? you legit are forced to read it because if you dont then you cant even have fun and that just breaks the point of the game ALSO fix the teleporting mouse glitch for chrome OS along with shift lock and first person not working. Its not bad but i recomend fixing the shiftlock,first person, and teleporting mouse glitch because its been a struggle for chrome book players for years"

2112,2113,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,5,Meme God monke Ayush Sarma,This is a game with over millions of platforms. You can play as anything you can imagine. The graphics and character models are 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻. What is more? You can even create your own games and other stuff. But sometimes it also glitches. But if we put the glitches away it is a 5/5 game. I highly recommend that everyone should play this game. Thank you!😁
2113,2114,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,5,Liz Legler,"This game is so fun! I love being able to play and talk with my friends. One of my favorite things about this game is that there's stuff for all ages. There's kid games for younger people, and more intense games for older people, and just lots of options and genres to choose from! Obbys, RPGs, building, tycoons, etc. I recommend it for people who love making friends and having a good time!"

There is never a day when everything is just perfect, there is always something wrong with it. Yet, roblox fives people many smiles and I am one of them and everyone loves the interaction with our friends and others. If u ever feel lonely just go up to a player! I love this game so much and I think more should play! (Hate the glitches)"
2119,2120,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,5,F411en_ang3l,"Roblox is a great game to play. It's basically a game full of mini games! Yes, you do need wifi to play it but if you're on a phone, you should be able to play it anywhere! Sometimes the games do get glitchy, but that mostly depends on what device you're playing on. I definitely recommend this game when you are bored."
2120,2121,2022-06-11,2022,06,11,4,Addy Adison,"I LOVE THE GAME. It's fun and I can play with my friends. Only problem is that is lags but without that I would say amazing. I have played this game ever since I was 7 years old. I have always loved this game and suggest people to play it! And I wish for the reports to work. Some are really urgent, and they do not get answered to and I hope for that to change. I send a report, but nothing happens after. The person bothers me again. So please fox the reports. And enjoy playing on roblox. 😝😝😝😝"
2121,2122,2022-07-16,2022,07,16,5,Claire Monaghan,"Roblox on PC/Xbox is great, there isn't really any issues, but mobile can be frustrating. When playing Roblox on older iPads (for me) or phones in general, sometimes the screen just freezes and then crashes. Otherwise, great game!"
2122,2123,2022-07-14,2022,07,14,5,Ashley Hutchison,"This is an amazing game, you play with friends meet people to make more friends and there is so many different games to choose from starting at scary horror games to fun delightful game, you can also talk to friends in the game by texting, and it is a kid friendly game so no cursing or any inappropriate things. You also have a variety of different clothes to choose from some that cost robux, which is the money name on the app, to ones that are free for ones who don't have it. Must get the app."
2123,2124,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,5,nisha chordia,"Great game I love it the animation,graphics,movement etc are really easy to control and edit one issue when I play on mobile and accidentally press the the pause button or something else you call it it gets like a glitch and your controls are messed up so please fix that overall this is a great game and I highly recommended you download it"
2124,2125,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,AT Hartline,"Fun+entertaining. Tags get annoying sometimes for example sis is taged. I think it's odd that a rule says ""No dating"" yet it has odd clothing that to me stands out and says ""online dating"". Recommended for kids 4-5+. The backgrounds in most of the games are amazing&are great for taking pictures and recording. Grafix and atuo are incredible probably best atuo I've ever had. I've been playing for 4 years and dont regret downloading! Overall good game."
2125,2126,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,3,Basia Carrera,"It's a pretty good game, but when i was buying money, and i canceled the purchase, yet it still used my money. It was only one dollar but i would like to have that dollar back, as i could have used that dollar for something. Besides that there isn't really anything i can think of off the top of my head, I'll add more if i can think about something. I thought of something, and its that i just got hacked :/"
2126,2127,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,4,thvxsands,"This app is very interesting! But the one thing I hate is sometimes I keep disconnecting from the experience, even though the wifi is fast. And sometimes I can't control the camera thingy like I can't control it or it's stuck. (sorry for my grammar)"
2127,2128,2022-07-21,2022,07,21,4,Naomi Lane,"Some bugs but, you can join endless games and updates all the time! Family friendly with kind people that you can make friends with. Just don't show personal stuff with them I would suggest getting your real life friends to play with. All languages play this! There is many mean people but don't listen to them. And be NICE. Overall this game is perfect! 💯"
2128,2129,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,4,Roger plays,"Hello Roblox! I've been playing this game for years now when i still have PC but i stopped when my PC broked lol. Some of my friends recently showed me this game. I really loved it! You've also improved your Roblox Support. Thank you very much for the regular updates. Update: idk if its on the app's side or the roblox game side. But, I've experiencing issues such as crashing constantly even i don't lag and sometimes my screen wouldn't work please fix this immediately. Regards, Roger."
2129,2130,2022-07-11,2022,07,11,5,Lexie Parry,I've been playing this game for 4 year ( I'm 12 now) I love it I have made so many friends that I talk to everyday personally I enjoy playing bloxburg and adopt me which are role-playing games other then this there are many other types of games such as obbys which is where you jump and climb to different places . Furthermore you get to make your own avatar I change mine ALOT its so much fun if you are looking for a game to pass time I would definitely recommend this. Have fun!
2130,2131,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Vrag6,"everything is good, all game is fun to play and adventurous,i only give four star is that because mobile has a lot of problem , Screen Problem it always glitching especially with high resolution game,and other is that mobile has no shiftlock so it would be unfair advantage for us fighting with a computer player (fighting game) so I'd suggest add shiftlock button from setting and make it optional."
2131,2132,2022-07-16,2022,07,16,5,Lilyana,"It's a great app because it has amazing games but there are two little things i dont like. First is that you have to buy robux, you should get to earn them by winning badges completing obbies, finding special parts in games, and more stuff like that. Second off, is that Bloxburg costs Robux, people should not be able to make games thats cost robux. Otherwise its great!"
2132,2133,2022-06-08,2022,06,08,4,bebo,"Been playing this game for four years now and I have to say, I enjoyed every second of it! The app has alot of games to play from and so much accessibility for cross platform players. The only problem I have faced is the mild cursing in some games that can ruin the experience. Other than that this app is amazing and would recommend to people who want to create or play games. This app is definitely worth a try! Stay safe, Have fun!"
2133,2134,2022-06-20,2022,06,20,4,Nicole Anielka,"It will be great if there's this feature. When player add friend another player and the other player doesn't accept, maybe in the friend feature there's should be 'added friend player'. And the player we add friend will be there. So, we still can be friend with them. Overall this game is good but there's still many jump or camera bug."
2134,2135,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,4,faizul raseli,I've been playing Roblox since 2018 and is a really great game pass the years but there's problem's that i hate with the game 1. Sometimes i can't rotate my screen it just stays at the place it want's to be 2. some times my avatar just keeps jumping 3. The Roblox moderation is very bad 4. Some times the screen follows where the joy stick is going and i always have to rejoin the experience
2135,2136,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,3,Melissa Allen,It's gotten worse over time every thing is so pricey now and when you by stuff they delete it from the shop and then you can't where it it's good if you want to make friends but it's not good if you're trying to dress up and get things like items to wear and many people are very toxic if you find a good Community you're very lucky to find one I just think the community has changed so much... Anyway to the point I hope you have a GREAT time if you get the game/already have it.
2136,2137,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,5,Nish D,BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!! You can play with your friends or just chill on your own. There is only ONE small problem i play on my tablet and it doesn't allow me on some of the games which is quite disappointing and sometimes it takes an age to load but other than that I highly recommend it. ☺
2137,2138,2022-06-21,2022,06,21,5,Malak Adus,"Roblox is a good fun game but the only thing I don't like about it is that I have to reconnect, and sometimes it kicks me out for no reason. There's also hackers and one time I tried a new account, and then I wanted to go back to my other account,but it didn't let me,. And whenever my WiFi connection is working properly it says please check your connection and kicks me out. Please fix these problems. Kind regards from Malak Adus♡"
2138,2139,2022-06-19,2022,06,19,5,No More,Fix camera for mobile users please it's been broken for like 3 years! Basically When you swipe the screen in the direction you want your character to move it'll randomly get stuck in zoom mode. Basically it mimics what happens when you pinch the screen with 2 fingers to zoom in or out and it stays that way!! You have to either restart the game or close it out or mess whith the settings until it stops glitching! Please help
2139,2140,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,4,Baylee Sharkey,It's cool but it really is hard sometimes because it will just go jumping and jumping so I think people should download it but beware there's bugs I love this app because it's actually really fun and you can do a lot of stuff there's games a lot of different ones and like there's probably like a million people you can make friends just really cool I think everyone should download it!
2140,2141,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,3,Meerab arsalan,"Ok im done. The app itself closes randomly while im playing a game. I ignored it for a LOOONG time thinking ""Oh maybe its because of my wifi or my storage"" but it literally isnt. I dont know if this is a bug but it needs to stop cause this has happened WAYYY too many times and is starting to get annoying. I hope yall can fix this asap cause i'm so close to deleting roblox since its so annoying"
2141,2142,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,2,Ng Beng Aik,Most of the games here are good but the unstable connection had ruined my experience even with good WiFi connection. It gets worse when using data connection so good luck if you try to play games that needs you to teleport often since they easily lose connection during transfer.
2142,2143,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,3,eh,"I've been playing this game for years and i only have a few complaints that only apply to certain devices (chromebook), it runs super slow and takes up alot of storage space.Also another complaint i have that applies to everyone who plays is how stupid the moderation is, it needs to be fixed.Nevertheless I enjoy roblox, which is why I've been playing it for years, and I would recommend you play it."
2143,2144,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,4,Deeqo ali,"It's an amazing game, dont get me wrong but there is 1 problem. On chromebook you can not scroll down? Im sure other chrombook player's feel the same way i do. And i randomlly get kicked for no reason. It say's Same account launched on diffrent device even though we have 2 step verifaction. I blamed my Wifi but i found out it was perfectly fine. Other than that, it is perfectly fine."
2144,2145,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Emily Schubert,"Overall I would say Roblox is an excellent game, but it takes forever to load on my Chromebook. It also has a lot of lag but I love the game idea. I love how you can play multiple games. Another problem is that it hashtags some words that aren't even bad, like the word phone. But Roblox is an excellent game! Recommed!"
2145,2146,2022-06-07,2022,06,07,2,Maximilian Picozzi,I don't like that you can't talk in chat when using a Xbox. There is this bug that is very annoying on mobile devices when you are using the dynamic thumbstick. Sometimes the game thinks you are trying to use it to look around. So then if you are using the look around control you will just zoom in or out. And sometimes it is stuck like that until you leave the game even when you aren't moving around.
2146,2147,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,4,ac skrill,"This is a very good game! But there are some issues that really irritate me. First problem is when you chat with other people it's supposed to let you type right? Not for me. I go to the chat and it just doesn't work. But it'll let me sometimes but, only a few times (Btw I'm on mobile). Next problem is some games don't work for me it'll just be too laggy to play and it'll kick me out for some reason. Last problem is when I join a game the ground will just be blue or other colors! Please fix!🙏"
2147,2148,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,4,Ahana Balamurali,"Very fun game but, there are some bugs. For example, I was playing Brookhaven and I couldn't move. It only let me zoom in and out. Another is that I was stuck in shift lock. Overall, great game."
2148,2149,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,3,Lavenders Lunatics,"This is a really great game and amazing stuff u can find here it's just that... every time I buy a new server it canceled randomly and it doesn't give me a refund when it does it just shuts down randomly I pay to have one and it just shuts down with no warning nor refund, Server just shuts down within a week of purchase... so beware if your buying a private serv. And if you buy accessories and the owner deletes it you don't get a refund on that either I would give 5 stars if this never happened."
2149,2150,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,4,Richard Daggett,"Well it's the best game with many other games to play , I love it really , but one thing is I don't like the bugs and lags in the game , I also hate the fact it sometimes doesn't let you in the game instead it keeps you in games like feild trip Z ,I also don't like how they upgrade the game so much maybe you should do it less than more , hope I helped ."
2150,2151,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,5,CrossWaveGaming,"So ive been playing since 6/17/2019. Great app. Hundreds of thousands of games to play. But their is a couple problems. Chat filter can be delayed meaning you can see the cuss words before them getting filtered out. Also you can get close to cuss words by using sybols. Also some games can be quite inappropriate. Also when trying to access part of your account for example, trying to chang the password, the box enlarges past screen length please fix this. Thanks for listening. I totally recommend."
2151,2152,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,3,Hiroshi Suzuki,"It's a very great game tbh, however the game takes up way too much space! And sometimes you just disconnect and your internet is fine, I think it might be something wrong with the servers for the disconnection. However overall it's a great game"
2152,2153,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,5,McKenna Zimmer,"I love this app so much and the great thing about it is you can play it on any device and it also has over one million games inside of it so you do not half to download 40 games on your device to play only 2 that you like. Although there are some bugs and gliches that I would love for people to fix. I would also recommend only letting people sell things for under 10,000 robux because I would love to get more things but they are so expencive!"
2153,2154,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Gaming With Lilly,"This is an amazing game 1 problem though, usually the camera gets stuck to where I can only move back and forth.I'd recommend this game to anyone, happily!I have added friends I know in real life so this game is a 4 star game, this is my favorite game yet.It is just the price of some things in the avatar shop you should lower the prices.You should fix it a bit."
2154,2155,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,5,Effie Linson,"I love this game! id give it a 9/10 but i have a couple of request. 1: that you can adjust the size of items you wear, like making hair bigger or lowering it down to fit right. my second request is that we can sell items and get part of the cost back. pls and ty ^^ keep up the good work!"
2155,2156,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,私はとてもクールです,"It is cool! I do want to say that it does dissapoint its players a little bit. For example, it has like events that we(players) don't like or don't know. Another one is new updates that we(players) don't like, as in 1 hair instead of multiple. I hate this ""update"" to be honest. Its such a down grade! We want multiple hairs still!(Im not saying that all players hate these things I am using examples). Anyway, it is a good game but there is downside that make their stocks go down. :) also the bugs"
2156,2157,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,4,Dan_iel,"I say 4 stars because Roblox has gone colorless when. When you log in back then it would say ""Welcome to Roblox"" and button to operate the avatar changer would be more difficult. Though I wish it was like back then when it was better. Also there used to be this vibrant red and blue theme on the front page. Now its black and white. A little boring but overall still a good platform Also please add the individual skin tone selector on mobile"
2157,2158,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,3,Tori Pomare,"Uhm I like this game but I have redownload it over 2x, I take forever to load, I hate smammers in adopt me/one of the games, That there are strangers in the game and thats all but I like the games, graphics, I can play with friends, You can make friends in a different area, nice people, cool avatars and the game too. So please fix these problems and dont remove adopt me from the game if your going to and have a good day :)"
2158,2159,2022-07-15,2022,07,15,5,sukayna Kashif,"This is a really nice game but so many bugs like sometimes I try to move but my camera shakes. 2nd sometimes I try to move my camera but it zooms in and out 3rd I cant move my character or camera 4th it lagges when i leave that one game, what happens is that I leave THAT 1 GAME and the music does not stop it shows that if u click a game that screen shows on iPad it stays there, does not load and just... yeah I have to rejoin making it lag and time wasting 5th the lag is the most problem."
2159,2160,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,4,Sunglasses Shades,"This game is overall the best game ever placed in Google Play Store, but I want to point stuff out. The layered clothing just keeps dominating on all the avatar shops, plus you added shoes which are useless considering most of the games don't support layered clothing. The clothing glitched my entire avatar and ruined it entirely. Classic clothing were the best, a million times better than layered clothing. Can you please seperate the layered clothing to a seperate website, like ""Roblox 2.0""?"
2160,2161,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,2,Cheekin,"Yeah uh, this new update sucks for Chromebook. Each time I try logging in it's as if it doesn't let me load, more or less it loads my avatar and such in, but not the interface. For other types of games, oh right, ""experiences"", I just can't load at all."
2161,2162,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Tyrianna Chaput,"This game is really fun, and there are so many game options to play and explore, but it can be laggy at times and there are some inappropriate things, but I love that you can make your avatar anyway you want, and can make lots of new friends and even chat with them, you can join groups and send chats to the owner of the group to show your support. This game is super fun."
2162,2163,2022-07-04,2022,07,04,4,icecreampaintdoll plays,"I give it a 4, Becuase it kinda lags and it doesn't show my shirt but I mean ITS SO good becuase it has over 1q games ;0; and u can make friends /stranger friends online! And u can creat games , clothing , accessories , and u can creat ur AVTAR! And u can chat with ur friends / stranger friends ON ROBLOX! and their is alot to do but their some glitches and bugs sometimes and lags a lot and crashed and disconnectes and everything is pricey like very pricey like 100$+ and that's why I rate it 4!"
2163,2164,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,4,Nirvan Kakoty,The game is nice and the best game iv ever played!! By the way there are some things for which i have given it 4 stars.. These are some common camera and joystick problems and the most annoying glitch is whenever i play a game then sometimes it quits me to the home screen AND THAT IS REALLY ANNOYING so please improve this things and i will give it 5 stars 👍
2164,2165,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Elijah Nicole Javier,This game is awesome but it always need to update so I'll give it 4 stars. It's a great game and I hope you fix some bugs because it's laggy sometimes and i always got disconnected even our internet is stable. Also why does this game always needs to update when a 1 just 1 game updated it shouldn't mean it needs to update the whole roblox. It seemed like it's twice or thrice a week.
2165,2166,2022-06-23,2022,06,23,5,Gacha Ekam,"This is a great game to play, Highly recommend it and its up to my standards of games. I love it!! The cost for robux is reasonable and cheap! The games and avatar items are amazing as well as the layered clothing. This is amazing! No problems at all. Perfect game keep up the work! 👌"
2166,2167,2022-07-15,2022,07,15,4,Brandy Olsen,"its a fun game but for certain games for example adopt me, Its extremely laggy on chromebook and its mainly that game im most lagy in. Im glitchy and laggy in almost all the games, Im not sure if the computer is the problem or the game has a bug? But overall the game is pretty good and entertaining!"
2167,2168,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,5,Kiara Carmichael,I like this game becuase you can make friends! And you can play any kind of game! I have been playing this game since 2016 and its been amazing. But there is one thing that the should fix. And thats is being laggy and having a ton of glitchs. Like brookhaven
2168,2169,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,5,Kaustav Sengupta,"It is a really great game. Although I admit there are a few glitches, but it doesn't matter. The graphics, camera work, design, player handling is awesome. My favourite game in this game is Carnival of Terror, the obby is a great game, & it's terror factor is kinda great. I have played some other games like Adopt Me, The Mimic, Arsenal, Bedwars & I liked it a lot. Hats off to the developers of Roblox. 👏👏👍👍😃😃😁😁"
2169,2170,2022-07-06,2022,07,06,4,Jax O'Dell,"It is a very great game, but I get disconnected alot due to error code: 277 Idk why this happens, but I made a second account to see if it was just a glitch, and it wasn't. I got disconnected from the same error code 277. Other than that, it is an amazing game."
2170,2171,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,5,Roofa Mohamed,Its a very good game and its so fun to play and make lots of friends all over the world . it has many games so u can't get bored And the games aren't only for kids but for all of the ages . It's my favorite game . but there is one problem which is sometimes when I am playing on my phone and try to look around with the screen it doesn't move or just zooms in and out.
2171,2172,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Ashly May,"I have rated this 4 stars. Roblox is such a fun app to explore but the only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I, honestly, believe that there are too many games which lag alot. Whenever I would join a game that I enjoyed, it would just lag to the point I have to leave roblox. Still, it is a good app. Moving on to voice chat, I find it quite weird that we have to give some sort of information to be able to get it. Information as in passports or ID. Overall, roblox is epic! I love it!"
2172,2173,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,2,FrostFlower,"It's a good game but I have a problem, when I'm playing a game sometimes the screen glitches when I zoom in and out. It's very annoying and I'll have to leave the game and then come back. Edit: nvm i take it back, it's not a good game. Roblox is literally getting attacked by hackers and they are banning accounts for no reason and what Roblox did about it ,yes that's right, absolutely NOTHING - they are posting some random YouTube videos acting like everything is fine. Maybe it's a plan? Idrk"
2173,2174,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,4,Jordan DA dolphin sanchez,"This app is amazing. i play it for every day. i would have rated it a 5 stars, but the game does have some glitches. for me sometimes i cant play some games becauze it says that i play on mobile even though im on computer. i dont know if that is the games fault or my fault but yeah thats really the only problem i encounterd."
2174,2175,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,5,Jan Kee,"Game is too bussin i was playing a lotta games like nico nextbots and more... My most favorite one is actully brookhaven, thanks Wolfpaq, also i need more games, here is an example: natural disasters survival 2, if you are like me just play some random games, but do not play games that hack your account like swan location and more... This is the end guys, goodluck :)"
2175,2176,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Kisba Legoabe-Nkabinde,I love the game and all but in some games thing s disappear allot like in Aqualiana water park when the stairs just vanished but other people could see them or in Brookhaven when half of everything is gone after a few minutes. Ones I was playing and I was in a big house and then half of the house was not there I would like it if you fixed this problem other than that I love the game.👍👎👍👎 Edit:Thank you for fixing it I have no problems now😁
2176,2177,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,3,Alex Workman,"Better parental controls!!!! We could only find ONE game she could play with controls on, So I had to turn off controls for my kid to be able to play anything... but then her ""suggested"" games are all scary looking and inappropriate. If I could remove those games from suggested ones, that would be nice."
2177,2178,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,Redway Flora,"This is a great game but their is just one bug, sometimes when I try to play, it won't let me move my screen and I basically call it the zoom in glitch so I have to leave the game and come back and also I don't like how you have to pay real money for robux, instead of that can we play games to earn robux. That's all this is a great game though"
2178,2179,2022-06-30,2022,06,30,4,Flexx,"I love roblox in my opinion. I've been playing for 5 years now and I really love the game. But there's a slight problem for mobile users now. not only I but others have experienced it, you see when you load into a game on roblox after a couple seconds/minutes you disconnect and get sent to the main screen where you have to close and reopen the app to try and play again. But the same thing happens again."
2179,2180,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,4,Anthony Pacheco,I love the game. Some of the people in game could be better. Actual good moderation in the game would be great since the moderation seems to be on it's final feet. Also maybe some options to make recommended games more made for you so you actually discover games that are in your interest.
2180,2181,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,2,Jesus Morcoso,"A masterpiece but mobile is somewhat worse: Firstly, on mobile you can crash or suffer from lags. Secondly, the controls are sometimes broken on low end devices and lastly, the way they update the game. They fix bugs but they don't even improve the way they make the game lag less (others don't even lag or crash). Being on pc is MUCH MUCH better than being on mobile. Roblox co. if ur reading this please do it especially the lag issue (•ω•)"

I have a problem with the screen (camera) it automatically just freezes and i gotta rejoin the game till it's back to normal And also my screen goes black whenever i play something while im talking to someone. I don't know if it's to my phone or Roblox but please fix it if its about Roblox. Overall a very beautiful and nice game i enjoy playing with friends"
2182,2183,2022-06-24,2022,06,24,2,Koopiecaca,If I'm being honest you should be able to delete the items that you don't want anymore and get back your robux become they be having new items almost every day it's Tring and the headless and koblox should not cost alk that it's a waste if money just to make your avatar and just a trash the games have gotten so boring and they pretty much want to delete every game but da hood which is werid but anyways I want a refund please. I'll give it a 2 out of 5 since.
2183,2184,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,5,Janerose Rafallo,"This game is AMAZING!! I love it, i would play this game everyday but there is only one problem.. glitches. I don't usually encounter glitches but it ruins the mood, i would have to rejoin and find my friends again, but still it's great! [Sorry if this review doesn't make sense to you.]"
2184,2185,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,3,Minas Ismail,Nice and the best but some problems really annoying. When i join any story game if i go into that everytime i go in that it says teleport failed. And if i go in a shooting or fighting it lagging so much it feel like it going to crash and i have a good network i go any other games its fine working. i go to the youtube it just fine its working too but if i go to roblox its just freeze not loading. and my one thing is i like this game so much and favourite too but plss fix the problems
2185,2186,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Ying Hao,"Roblox is a very fun game to play as you can play with friends and there is millions of games to choose from....... But I gave it a 4 I have 3 reasons: 1, Some times when I wanna play bedwars for mobile📱 I always can't move my screen in the middle of the match and it is very annoying😳. 2, yesterday I played adopt me and I got LAGGED OUT 8 TIMES😡. (Please fix this) 3, sometimes when I move the stick it will move my screen and it always happens when I am playing bedwars! Thanks if fixed!😁❤"
2186,2187,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,3,Freddy Johnson,"The game is fine but playing with touch screen can get frustrating so I'd like to use my mouse and keyboard the only issue is the mouse does not lock to the screen, for example going in first person when using a mouse if I spin my mouse it will get stuck on the side of the screen, and you might say ""oh it's your phone"" no it's not because there are multiple games that I play that lock the mouse like Minecraft. I think a good fix is to have an option for keyboard and mouse only. Signed Freddy."
2187,2188,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,3,Jasleen Monsivais,"There is tons of games you can play on this, such as obbys, parkors, and tycoons and lots of more different type of games!! I would definitely rate this game 5 stars, but, the problem is that there is a lot of bullying and scamming in most games, which I think is very messed up, their reporting also never works. This game also doesn't do anything about the inappropriate games or the clothing on here! So for this, I will give it 3 stars."
2188,2189,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,4,WorldDino YT,"its fun i got new friends to play in there also, the important thing. The bugs, roblox should fix it. My screen freezes when i accidentaly pressed the menu button. Well, you can fix it by a vehicle seat in some games, if theres a screen fixer(vehicle seat) though. Anyone have a game? If you do, then u can add a vehicle seat if you want. Have a nice day everyone out there :)"
2189,2190,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,5,Rianna O'Brien,It is really fun and it helps you find people with the same interests but if you tap the screen three times on a mobile device it freezes the camera and if u zoom in all the way and don't zoom back out before leaving you can't move the camera at all if you could fix that it would be awesome it's the best game I have downloaded :)
2190,2191,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,1,Hunter Helmsley Gabriel Manansala,"I love ROBLOX, but I have seen a bunch of other people having complaints about the camera, the joystick, the disconnecting, and much more other things all happening on mobile. I am having the same problems. But not once have I seen any complaints involving a PC. Roblox, please fix these things that are happening to mobile players like me. If this goes on, then i might just end up uninstalling ROBLOX. But there's a small chance of that happening. Still, please fix these bugs!"
2191,2192,2022-07-15,2022,07,15,4,Paul Jannusch,"Amazing but there are some issues. Like when I go jump, the button will get stuck and I can't jump. Or when I'm walking around I turn the joystick to far it will keep me at one angle. Like say I'm walking and then I go to turn and it makes it so then I walk with the turn side of the screen. Otherwise it's a great game. And so fun."
2192,2193,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,3,Tiffany Desiree,Love the games it provides. But some games do lag along with the customization of your character. Causing players to have bald spots because the hair doesn't go on the correct way & double shirts as well. Please fix..
2193,2194,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,4,Kenny maxi,"great game, but it has some flaws. Esc key suddenly dissapears, its like its been removed. You can't even click on the invisible menu, its gone. The items in the game are gone aswell. It'd be great if you added shiftlock for chromebook!"
2194,2195,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,5,Kadijah Green,"I have been playing this game since 2018, it is a really good game. There are many different games you can choose from too, not only that but you can also decorate your character, make new friends and create your own games. But not gonna lie but it gets boring sometimes so maybe play with someone to make the experience better?"
2195,2196,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,4,Harris Hannah Rosse Arysha,This game is one of my top favorite games . And I love to play it at my free time. But I gave a 4 star because it's a bit lag and I have to left the game because of the dragging it's always changing to zoom in zoom out when I tried to drag .and my internet connection is good and then the game disconnected me when I have problem in it like getting scammed.
2196,2197,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,3,Kirtney Aba,My experience was *ok* it was just that my screen kept glitching then I couldn't see then all letters in game blurred then I get disconnected then I get stuck in a never ending loading screen then so I could play again I have to close the game then enter it again. Also some games are very laggy
2197,2198,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,4,Chloe Lam Koh Nee,"It's a good game but there are some bugs needed to fix. First, the screen movement. It'll keep on zooming in or zooming out, it is so annoying. Second, is it me or sometimes I can't update my Roblox when it needs to update."
2198,2199,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,McKenzie Smith,It's really good but sometimes it's really glitchy. But other wise in my opion I think it's really good other then the glitches that happen. But there only in certain games. There is so many games to choose from u can cutomize ur avatar with robux and there not expensive.
2199,2200,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,5,Al - Roblox,"Very fun game. But for some reason, I don't know if this happens in other games. But whenever I go into Flee the Facility, there are times where I can't open the chat box for some reason, it doesn't show the people chatting. Hope that changes"
2200,2201,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,5,Criddle Lee,"I Love this game it's really fun there's so many games to play. But the only thing that needs to be fixed is all the glitches example when I touch my screen with 3 fingers it zooms out and in also it won't let me move. BUT you guys need to downloaded it my 4 fav games a Brookhaven,Adopt me,tycoons and Daycare hope those are your fav too!🙃💜😎"
2201,2202,2022-07-09,2022,07,09,4,Kimberly Gutierrez Yanez,I love playing it but a lot of the games are super laggy (I'm pretty sure that's just my device tho) and u need robux for pretty much EVERYTHING but I can't get any cause I'm broke- also I have to keep downloading Roblox again and again cause every time I try to look in a direction it doesn't move and when I fix it it stays like that for like 5 min. and then it happens again.
2202,2203,2022-07-02,2022,07,02,3,Lupita Duarte,Well it is really fun but they are really Alot of bugs and uno really cool lots of new games they are also creative this is why I give it a three maybe you can give starter people robux they would need it and yeah this is a fun game I play it every day every morning and every night love it!!! So much yeah so maybe fix some things it would be Alot better bigger and lots and lots of people would love to play no hate just need some fixes.:)
2203,2204,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,5,Crystal Yabiix,"Tips for people who have some difficulties on glitches! If your jumping nonstop ( mostly on mobile ) - Just tap your roblox icon and exit from the settings on your game! If your screen keeps zooming in / out no matter how you try - there is no way to fix it in the settings, but you can just rejoin. +THATS ALL THE GLITCHES I KNOW BYE+"
2204,2205,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Mackenzie Carter,"The game is truly amazing and fun for all ages. It's great for entertaining kids and there are things you can learn from nearly every game you interact with. I feel like there should be some type of point system in order to earn Robux though seeing as not everybody can afford them but at the same time, that's just my opinion. I love this game and would 100% recommend it to anybody. ♡"
2205,2206,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,3,Lizzie Noel,I love this game! I've been a player since 2019 but I've been expriencing bugs. Sometimes when I close the app while playing a Roblox game my camera/screen becomes broken. It occurs on pc too but not a lot. I can't play the game cuz of the loading. I have good internet but it says theres no service.
2206,2207,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,nephyr,"this game is great and whatnot - but there are way too many bugs for such a popular game. Avatar loading screen sometimes just stops working, roblox refuses to open etc. another suggestions would be - to add a bigger limit to accessories, on mobile you have to get to a website and use desktop mode which is really annoying doing it so often"
2207,2208,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,4,Danielle Ligenza,"Honestly, its an awesome game! My only complain might be the lagging in some random games when my internet connection is fine. Also when I buy clothes they dont load when i put them on. But overall the game is very fun! Their are tons of games to choose from and each and every one of them are fun!"
2208,2209,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,2,Tonyette Brown,"Roblox is a good game but i have many complaints ima just say two, one, i cant join any games rn. Im just stuck on the screen ur on before you join the game. Two, in some games after 4 mins or more, the whole app just crashes its mostly in a game called ""spary paint"". Please fix this and maybe i'll leave a better review. Oh yea, i have an galaxy phone and its really laggy when i go into games, even when i have it on low graphics! Again, Please fix this and maybe you will get a better review."
2209,2210,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,3,Mark Potter,"I love the game. It does have a few flaws though. Everything I like costs robux, and it ruins the experience for me because I don't have any, so I am unable to do a LOT of things. Secondly, the chat system tags so many things that are appropriate that it's ridicuous. Third, I get random warnings of things I didn't do. Fourth, there are toxic people, scammers, and creepy stalkers everywhere. Only download this if you are aware of the costs. Other than that, awesome game!"
2210,2211,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Andrea Ellington,"this experience is great. I would definitly recommend downloading this as the games that people make are great. The graphics r so smooth. The updates r amazing and this game is basically for everyone as it's a place to relax and have fun with all different games at different styles. Roleplays,obeys,survival. Everything."
2211,2212,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,JELLY Luxury Stxr,"This app is great it ive been playing for 5-6 years no problem, has more than a million experiences you can also be friends with many people. I do have a problem with stuff like 200 max friend and then filter of ROBLOX although the filter is for younger ages since it's 10+ but many times I've typed in something like ""Well"" or ""it"" like a million times and it just tags it for no reason so that's why I gave it 4 stars but yeah so recommend when bored."
2212,2213,2022-07-13,2022,07,13,4,Michael Walter,"This is a really good app, but the only things stoping from rating five stars is the bugs, and the chat sensor being out of cotrol. The bugs I have gone in many games and had it glitch to where when I use the joy stick it would not move my charater, it would just move the camara angle. or I would not be able to move the camara angle, and that can make it hard to do many things. Also some times you can't see what you are typing in chat, it also sensors: hi hello I Other than that it is a good app"
2213,2214,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,4,Clover 2,"Pretty good, never crashes, loads of different games to play, the only thing I'd want to change is the online dating, when I was younger there was so many online daters(there still is), but I remember being a young kid around about 7 and having people doing certain inappropriate stuff and having people not care what age I am and still wanting to do you know what. I don't want young kids now to have to see that stuff, it made me as a young kid understand stuff I shouldn't. Otherwise good game."
2214,2215,2022-07-15,2022,07,15,3,Vampriella YT,"So many issues with mobile right now. The screen glitching is annoying, will only zoom in and out while playing a game after awhile. Sometimes you can't move at all, have to completely rejoin the game. Screen glitch for mobile still not fixed pls fix it."
2215,2216,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,3,Sandy Stockmon,"tho updates can at times be long and ""experiences"" can lag plentifully most of the time it works just fine,espesually once you find the types of games you enjoy,also forgot to mention that on touch-screen sometimes when you try to use the joystick it will also alter camer derection...please fix this."
2216,2217,2022-07-24,2022,07,24,3,Ken david Panganiban,"It's a good game but yet lots of bugs for mobile players, firstly the camera gets bugged most of the time like when you try to move so you drag the moving thing but then your screen also moves, also it's very hard to communicate to others If almost everything gets censored (pls fix that almost everyone hates that) and of course please just please fix the camera bugs it's very hard to play with mobile and sometimes there is when the screen zoooms in and out pls fix it"
2217,2218,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,WeirdPerson,"It's a great game, HOWEVER, there are some things within this game that kind of annoy me. When I first got Roblox I bought some stuff and they disappeared, I spent money on that which was obviously a mistake. Along with whenever I joined a glitchy game it would kick me out of the sever. Other than that it's overall a splendid game"
2218,2219,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,3,Aidan Mateo,"I like Roblox because there is lot of fun games you can play but I do have problems with it first of all it is so laggy even tho I have good internet, second sometimes the stupid joystick moves the camera which is really annoying and have to change it to a different joystick and third when I try move the camera left and right it just zooms in or out so you can fix these problems I would be happy and rate 5 stars"
2219,2220,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,2,Ahmad Hasan's Channel,"It's a fun game but there are 2 annoying things. 1- Sometimes my camera just becomes weird and I can only zoom in and zoom out but I can't move it up, down, right, or left. 2- I wish there was something in the settings like Auto jump on-off because autojump is so annoying."
2220,2221,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,ilovecats,It is really fun and you get to pick what you wanna play. It is glitching a lot when you have like four bars you need like five to actually play. That does get annoying. But overall it is an awesome game.
2221,2222,2022-07-23,2022,07,23,5,Jan Bernadette Enriquez,"I love this game so much. I've been playing this game for 2 years. But tbh... The price of the robux is really high. can you atleast like lower the price of the robux? or add a refund button? But to be honest the game is fun. But there is also another bug and its some when i walk it looks down and sometimes i cant even move my screen. Pls fix this issue that would be great. Also, when you report a player for doing smth against roblox's term and services, it dosent do anything so please. Fix it."
2222,2223,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,4,Samantha Richards,"This game is good in all but when I play on mobile glitches start to happen for example when I try to play a game my phone will be stuck up not side way which makes it super hard to play any game. Some games will be normal others I will not be able to play unless on pc because of the screen. Second, when my screen goes in and out. Usally my screen goes in and out causing me not to be able to move it. And sometimes my jump pad doesn't work either. The game would be so much better without glitches"
2223,2224,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,3,mariyah owens,"Fix this app. I really like playing the games but this is extremely buggy! I know I'm not the only one who has that problem when you join a game and your in it for about 5 minutes and you get kicked out of the app/game. It's extremely frustrating, especially when I play with my peers. Fix this now please or at least tell me how to fix it :( I really want to play Roblox correctly. I will edit if fixed."
2224,2225,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,2,BlueGrime,"Toooooo many bugs. I can't say Muslim or Islam and I personally think its a good game, but instead of focusing on random celebrity clothings and new updates, I say you fix the lag, all the glitches and bugs. 1, when you walk with the joystick (pretend u are walking forward) the screen would go up. 2, the screen doesn't move. 3, whenever you try to move your screen, it goes in and out of your character. 4, when in a game, you get sent out of the game and see a white screen that says Roblox."
2225,2226,2022-07-10,2022,07,10,2,ZuhxInx,"What id 17 even supposed to mean. Because it always showed up when I'm trying to enter the experience. I don't think my connection was a problem nor my phone's performance. It's really annoying when it's happen. Also I always disconnected from the game out of sudden. And it always happen after 10 minutes in game, I am pretty sure my connection is strong enough. Disappointing. This is not a game if you can't play at all. There is no solution for this. Even using VPN. Too many connection problem."
2226,2227,2022-07-01,2022,07,01,4,Lola Wilbourn,"it's an amazing game, played it all my life, but it is so glitchy and constantly goes down or has audio issues. at least once or twice a month, there's an outage, and it can get so laggy on some devices rather than others despite it being so universal. i love it and have made amazing memories and friends, but this game still really needs to do better."
2227,2228,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,4,Josh vance,"The thing I like is that you can change ur character and play alot of different games with friends. The thing that should change is everything should be free, yea you make a lot of money from it but still. Then,you should be able to have unlimited friends."
2228,2229,2022-06-05,2022,06,05,3,Melody Mauney,This game is very fun to play. it has thousands of games. But an issue with the games is that the bad and inappropriate games aren't getting banned. I never really had a problem with it until my youngest sister (6) found a really inappropriate occurrence with one of the games. Roblox needs to get back on there feet and deal with this. Also hackers are a big problem now the problem is so big I find at least one in every game. Please try to fix this. Overall the game is so fun and neat.
2229,2230,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Jailene Mendez,"It has a lot of fun games and you can play with your friends and meet new people But the only thing I don't like is that it sometimes glitches and then I just leave the game and come back, sometimes it's fixed when I come back sometimes it's not but either than that it's a really fun game I just want roblox to fix this glitches and then it will definitely be a fun game ."
2230,2231,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Aiden G,"my opinion that if you like simulations and exploration games and combat games Roblox has the game for you, but it also has its problems. Like there is a common camera glitch going on in a lot of games where your camera will freeze up and then just move down and nothing else."
2231,2232,2022-07-03,2022,07,03,5,Rye,"Could you guys bring back the options to change price and stuff to the shop for clothing, it's really useful I don't understand why it disappeared. I'd also like to add onto that, half my hairs disappeared, idk if it doesn't wanna show the other half or they took it away, same with body parts too."
2232,2233,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,1,Galen Blue,"The website and app are constantly having issues where you have to wait for chat to catch up just to talk, there's times where the website needs maintenance or is overall really slow no matter what device. It's really hard to play games on mobile since walking is difficult and it's near impossible to aim because despite you having the shift lock setting, they got rid of the shift lock button to help aim and move around better on mobile. Overall the game went downhill from its former glory"
2233,2234,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,4,makayla davis,Roblox is a really good game but the reason I give it four stars is because sometimes it can like disconnect and you're in a really good map and a different game so you like lose the entire map have to go to a totally different server when there was a rare item in that server or something like that.😁😅
2234,2235,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,3,gamer world,Many games to choose from so you won't get bored. My only concern is that the app consumes too much data. Played it about 5 hours and it already used 1.5gb from my data allocation thats almost double compared to streaming a whole series in netflix.
2235,2236,2022-06-20,2022,06,20,5,Pony girl,"It's a great game, I have been playing it non stop for a year now and I also like that you can customise your avatar into almost anything you want. Some of the games are really gems but some games are a bit trash but that's because anyone can make games so you will see nine year olds making poop simulators. Something else that bothers me is the chat filter it tags out alot of odd words I know that it is there to protect children and that you can turn it off if you are 13 but it gets in the way."
2236,2237,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Mike Vickers,"Amazing, but Something needs to change, There's something called ""online daters"" yea that needs to stop! Whenever i join a game of Brookhaven(just an example) sometimes all I see is a bunch of weird and inappropriate chats! This is a kids game!! Not just adults are on this game, other than that everything in the game is great! 5 star if Online daters get in trouble! Other than that 4 star pretty good!"
2237,2238,2022-07-11,2022,07,11,5,Autumn Meyers,All the games are really enjoyable and there are people from all over the world that play with you and you can get friend requests which means people ask to be your friend you're not allowed to give any personal information away and they give tips in case like people scam you and you can report people they really listen to online safety and I find that makes me feel more safe myself and more comfortable and all my friends can play. It's just really fun 🤠
2238,2239,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,tammy campbell,Very good game. But when I join some of the games I get kicked off or my screen stops moving side to side to in and out no matter how you move it around. I usually have 4 bars of internet so I know it's not that. Please fix that bug 😊😁
2239,2240,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,5,Jeb Gamer Official,"Super Fun! Almost INFINITE Games To Play, You Can Costumize Your Character. It Does Have A Little Bug On Phones Where I Open The Menu That You Use To Leave/Reset/Friend And More, And When I Exit It, The Screen Goes.. Strange. It Like When I Try To Move The Camera/View It Just Zooms In Or Out. Kinda Annoying That It Makes Me Need To Rejoin The Game To Stop it, The Lack Of Robux Is Kinda Annoying But I Feel Like Its Teaching Me How To Spend Money Wisely. Definitely Recommend. 4 And A Half Stars."
2240,2241,2022-06-16,2022,06,16,4,Jane Shadows,"Roblox is a amazing game but there are some clear problems. Bullies, toxic players, bugs, the game randomly making me and even my friends leave, and the carma randomly breaking. The most problems I have is the carma breaking and the game randomly making me leave. Despite the problems it's a good game overall."
2241,2242,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Neil S,"Suitable for 8+, but if you have a child that really wants to play, they have restrictions for parents to set, like no chat and certain games. Fun, and let's your creativeness come out!! I think the robux are a little bit too expensive, but really enjoy the game anyway. Thank you for creating a very fun app."
2242,2243,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,5,Lauren Gibs,I love it because you can meet more people and make new friends and you can also see what it's like to be like different kids like in Brookhaven there's so much things you can explore and especially lots of other games are really fun and Arby's are really interesting cuz people make different designs than other people so I recommend this game for you to make new friends and play lots of new games
2243,2244,2022-06-18,2022,06,18,3,SHĪ ZØ,"I recommend playing this game seems pretty fun But There's a huge problem..The camera Froze And I can't move it if i went to the menu, Also,The Controler sometimes Move by itself When i jump Yeah so I don't have a choice but to Go to the menu, Also Some mobile Players would appreciate it If you fix these bugs and I'd also appreciate that 😊💖"
2244,2245,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Lovely,"Roblox is a great game and I've played it for quite a few years. But I've always had the same issues, sometimes it doesn't even work when I try to open the app it says ""there's a bug on this app, please try again later."" When there isn't and it's working for My friends?? I've done everything and it still does it. And the chat filter sucks, I try saying ""what's your name"" and it just tags to ""what's your ####"""
2245,2246,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,José Gutiérrez,I LIKE this game but i don't like it when I press settings my screen gets wonkey and i have to re join again it takes so long. For the update it just takes so long and it just loads and loads it says to delate some games after it says Google play isn't working. I'll give it four stars.
2246,2247,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,A Google user,"I found this a great game but i have some things about roblox that concern me.1) Sometimes i can't move my character or screem which causes me to leave .2)Why you have to pay for robux it is not fair! 3) I think it would be better if i can leave the screen on without getting disconnected for not moving the screen for 20 minutes .Otherwise, i think this is a good game to play with friends and would be better if there was no bugs or lags.I love this game!!!"
2247,2248,2022-07-15,2022,07,15,3,Chxian Bongbonga,"This game is incredible. Although, I always get problems with the Games, Internet Connections, Et Cetera... This is a fun game. But, the system annoys me whenever it disconnects me for no specific reason. Nevertheless, Hackers in every games are spreading and If you're gonna ask me, I believe that this game needs a strong moderation against Cyber bullying, Hacking / Exploiting, creating explicit games that includes n*des and many more things that is explicit for the Minor people's safety."
2248,2249,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,2,Shahbaaz Guraya,"This is a great game to express your creativity and experience others as well. However, that said creativity on ROBLOX has (In My Opinion) degraded. The game is now full of games like tycoons and simulators and the top games are not that fun. Also the mobile UI is abhorrent. I can't edit my phone number or Email. And the quality is potato. Please fix this."
2249,2250,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,5,Generic Bunny,"its a fun game, but i cant walk after clicking anything you can type in. i have had roblox for about 4-5 years and have never had this problem until i had to delete it so i could update the app (the app said that it had an update, but when i went the the google play store on my chromebook to update it, it didnt say it had an update). so i deleted and reinstalled it. it would be awesome if you guys fixed this because i usually play games such as adopt me and meepcity, and its really annoying."
2250,2251,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,4,Yamii Jayden,I gave it a 4 out of 5 because literally this game is insane literally you can do anything but except it's too lagging and everything and they need to make new adjustments because they have too much glitches and Brookhaven you later can go under the map and he has to keep restarting and when you when you restart it takes you under the map again like but the game is Brookhaven is fixed now except when you get banned and you leave the game it unbanned you for some reason
2251,2252,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,5,Mikayla Cruz,I love this gameI really recommend it! You should get it! But the only problem I have with it is that in games from some reason if I'm afk for like 2 second or so sometimes my camera will act weird and when I try to rotate my camera it just zooms in and out and I'm unsure of how to fix it.
2252,2253,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,3,lydia cielo,"on some games like adopt me or those games with a loading screen they dont load and youre just stuck on the loading screen forever.ive tried leaving and rejoining,ive tried restarting roblox,ive tried playing on different devices.it still never loads the screen.i would like it if the creator could fix it. Lately,whenever i try to open roblox it takes hours to load and crashes a lot,or,when im in the middle of a game roblox will just close and say its not responding."
2253,2254,2022-07-07,2022,07,07,5,valentina moffatt,i think this game is wonderful its an app full of games and lots of fun but i really dont like how you have to pay actual many for in game credits i would put it as an option if you can pay for them but i would also like if you could to tasks or something to get in game credits ( robux))))) thanksbut overall i would rate this game 4 starts its an amazing app download it right now!!:)
2254,2255,2022-06-09,2022,06,09,5,Owl Squard,"The game is a great game! You can make virtual friends, customize your character, play games with your friends and many more! There are over 100 games to choose from, there isn't exactly a problem with the game at all. (Besides the toxic players) The steps are simple to create an account. You put down your birthdate, make your Username and Password then you pick your gender and boom! Your account is made just like that. Highly recommended! It has education games, pvp games, art games & more!"
2255,2256,2022-06-22,2022,06,22,4,Hannah Brock,This is a really good game but sometimes my screen freezes and my phone just starts to zoom in and out when I try to turn my avatar and some of the clothing on Brookhaven just makes you naked so you need to fix these problems but other then that I really love the game. Thanks for creating Roblox.
2256,2257,2022-07-21,2022,07,21,2,Daniel D,"Nice but i have some problems. 1. When I lag out, it keeps me on the loading screen so I have to restart it, which is time consuming. 2. Now everytime I go onto Roblox, it says no internet, WHEN THERE IS, causing me to restart AGAIN. Please fix this because I love this app but with that it is just a bit more unplayable."
2257,2258,2022-07-15,2022,07,15,4,oDaiCu KillerRo,"ya'll, who are mad about the cam bug, just rejoin or reset your character, and besides that, a custom menu would be for sure welcomed. Oh and btw, make so that i dont have to aim with the joystick when i play shooters, like where i tap in the right side there it should go."
2258,2259,2022-07-04,2022,07,04,3,monaliza Ariles,"This game is ok but there is a LOT of problems.. like in the catalog I try to put on a hair but it doesn't show no matter how much I wait it still doesn't show.. and whenever I'm using the phone to play roblox, the screen sometimes doesn't work like bruh it's hard.. and then it censor whenever I say ok.. like is ok a badword now? Tbh alot of these bugs are getting annoying.. like lag, tags and bugs.. please fix it roblox!!!!"
2259,2260,2022-07-05,2022,07,05,4,Tiffie Tink,"This app is the best! Except a couple things but 1st I will tell you why it is so great. 1st of all you can customise your character and play obbies! 2nd in lots of roleplay games like adopt me or Brookhaven you can customise your character even MORE freely and test what they would do if U did something and back to the bad part. 1st one is Cyber Bullies, you can easily get bullies online as well as ODERS and 2nd of all is if U put 3 or more fingers on the screen you can't move the camera anymore"
2260,2261,2022-06-28,2022,06,28,5,Bobo Tapologo,"Nice game and there are a lot of games in Roblox CHECK ROBLOX OUT HOMIE! But there are bugs I'm using mobile and the screen won't work it will go zoom in and zoom out, they better fix these bugs I mean I don't hate the game i just hate the screen problem 😤 but it's the best game ever..... I don't know but people keep posting screen problem and the lag, crash, disconnected and other stuff, so pleas Roblox fix your gameeeeee please 🥺👏"
2261,2262,2022-07-19,2022,07,19,4,Lisa Hinds,"This game is so amazing! I've been playing for 2 years now and you can experience so much fun. The only thing i will say is that i wish that the ones who make the clothing, hair, and accs would at least make a few good items free. But anyway this game is amazing. UvU"
2262,2263,2022-06-14,2022,06,14,5,ItsYuri _PlayZ,"It's really good! You can play different kinds of games,create your own game and many more things! The free things that u guys added are super cool and enough to make any vibe avatar. One problem. For people who can't get robux need to sell stuff. You still have to pay 10 robux just bc of selling it. Its kind of messed up but I'm giving you 5 stars :)"
2263,2264,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,4,Ashley Kight,I give this 4 stars because there are a few bugs and as i read the other reviews I see most people have this problem sometimes when i open the player list accidentally and exit out of it my screen locks and i can only zoom in and other times when I move my joystick my screen moves with it but other than those problems I really love this game and I play it frequently!
2264,2265,2022-07-22,2022,07,22,3,Jannah Pandita,"Roblox is a very nice app. There are lots of games to play there. But there has been a bug that mostly everyone is experiencing in the app. Basically your screen gets stuck, and to fix it you have to leave the game. Which is very annoying to most of us, especially me. I hope you fix this Roblox. Would be very happy if you do."
2265,2266,2022-07-17,2022,07,17,1,Arham Jain,It's a good game and I'm playing it from a couple of years I've two issues with this game no.1 - it's very very much laggy. No 2 - For mobile players there are only two inventory slots and for pc players there are 10 slots It is like to cheat with thoose players that can not afford a computer. Games like ultra power simulator the mobile players are helpless when there all active slot's powers (only three) are on cool down and on the other hand the pc players can use 10 powers and easily wins fix
2266,2267,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,4,Dhiji Vivek,"This is the best game ever! But sometimes will lag, kick people out of the games there playing, and once, it even let me have to join back a few times and i once had log back in but my account wasnt saved! But Over all, it's a very nice multiplayer game."
2267,2268,2022-06-29,2022,06,29,5,Sebastian Rodriguez,This game powering imagination right now!! i love it!!! it has very cool games ans relaxing songs!! But may they stop deleting sounds or musics?? Some might be copyrighted but idk.. its just it makes the experience quiter and some developers dont even check/notice.. so ya! i love this game! its on good shipshape shape
2268,2269,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,5,Sade-was-here,"Roblox is great, I love roblox. But the updates are too often I get why constant updates but they are way to often like every 2 months or 3 would be fine. And the second problem is the loading my roblox almost never loads I have to restart my device over and over again constantly for it to load and the games take forever to load along with details of people account again way too long. I would love it if roblox would fix those issues of the game I would appreciate it very much roblox is the best"
2269,2270,2022-06-26,2022,06,26,2,chased,I kept on getting kicked out of game due to errors and can't even enter nor play. I already updated it but it's still the same. I hope this will be fixed sooner. Plus many people experience this. This game always has a lot of errors and crashes. Please fix this.
2270,2271,2022-06-13,2022,06,13,5,Dolly Estephan,This app is great but there is only one problem it's that when I join some games they lag very much and I can barely do anything. And on many games my keyboard takes 2 minutes to load it's very annoying. And when some games lag a lot my screen freezes for 5 minutes and I have to power it off. And sometimes it disconnects me Every 3 minutes. Please fix this it would be amazing thank you for understanding!
2271,2272,2022-06-20,2022,06,20,5,chris whye,"great game! but there are sum bugs that make most games unfair. whenaver your in first person on chromebook os, than your mouse would go off screen and you can't move the screen anymore. it would be delightful for the developers to fix this problem"
2272,2273,2022-06-15,2022,06,15,5,LOJI,"I hope for the future of Roblox are. letting us adjust the jumping button in our phone because it's really hard cause it's in the corner of the screen and it's messing up with my game play especially in obstacles, I have a really long thumb I really have to bend it so hard because it's really in lower corner of the screen. I still like this game after all this game is really The Greatest. 🤍"
2273,2274,2022-07-16,2022,07,16,5,Diana Silveira,"its super fun and awesome, has lots of diffrent games to choose from, and you can create your own games or play other peoples games, decorate your character, a little bit of decorating your profile! The best part is, is that you can play with your freinds and family! The rest is fun and games!!!!"
2274,2275,2022-07-08,2022,07,08,4,Gabriella Batson,"it is REALLY fun only a couple problems when i on my phone playing certain games it will glitch me out even though its not old and when i try to turn my camera instead of turing it will zoom in and out instaed of turning so i have to leave and rejoin and if i reset it starts glitching out on my phonebut no other problems fix it, i change it back to 5 star :)"
2275,2276,2022-07-20,2022,07,20,3,Vivaan Bartariya,"This game is great, on other devices. I have been playing on my android tablet for years but recently I started to play on my phone. The resolution is just garbage on max graphics. It is strange that this is happening on high end devices"
2276,2277,2022-06-26,2022,06,26,4,Eliana Clements,"it is amazing! I love that I can serch anything and at least 10 games pop up. I like that I can friend my own friends or people i have played with. However, it can be really slow and or glitchy. this may just be a pronlem with the itoms I play on so dont take my word too much on the glitchyness part."
2277,2278,2022-07-18,2022,07,18,5,sofia v,"Roblox, is really nice. all though i am experincing some glitches. Like in certain games it always glitches me out of the whole game, and when i try again it does the same thing. This is a good game, little kids are on here. and its ok, i have no problem with it. Your game should be counted as 8+. Roblox is getting boring, i started 2020 and its now 2022. ive spent at least i think 3 yrs on this game, i love the jumpscares in horror game. Keep up the good years and work Roblox."
2278,2279,2022-06-06,2022,06,06,4,Sandhya Mishra,I love this game. Although it has many lags and glitches like when I start my game it all right but after like 5-10 mins I can't see my face at all and I can't even turn into the direction where my face is and it lags a lot. And also there are many bullies so I was asking if you could make some things free and without robux so that no one can look poor. Please Fix these problems.
2279,2280,2022-06-27,2022,06,27,4,Sohaila allam,"This is the best game I ever saw in my life because this game is like a real game. because it has frozen elsa and Anna. and it has all my dreams. meep city, adopt me and Brookhaven 🏘️ RP is my favorite games. Also it's a fun game to play with friends. But one problem is that the updates don't really make any difference:/ wich is kinda annoying because I have to delete it and install it again BC it doesn't work without uninstalling it please delete the updates."
